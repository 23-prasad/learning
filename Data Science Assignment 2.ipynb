Unfortunately, I failed miserably at that. Here's why:1) It took 40 minutes to do an oil change at 8AM opening, no lines. 2) The service manager used bait and switch tactics on me. 3) He used fear tactics to try and get me to do an expensive $1580 repair. 4) This shop didn't really want to honor the $10 oil change coupons they sent out. I would suggest that they try and build trust and loyalty with the community instead of scams. Needless to say, I won't be coming back and I can't wait to own a Tesla so I don't have to deal with shops like these anymore. I'll have to look for another oil change place for my next time. I wished Vegas had honest and quick shops like the OILMEN in Los Angeles where I moved from. Here's the timeline of events that transpired for me: Got there at 8:03. Service manager greeted with a smile. I presented with the $9.99 coupon for oil change. His face changed immediately from welcoming to disappointment. He tried bait and switch, telling me my hybrid requires full synthetic and that I couldn't use the oil on the $10 coupon. I said no, I like the regular stuff. He hesitantly told me to go check in with the clerk, they will use the regular oil as I requested on my car. I checked in. A few minutes later the technician brought the car up on the lift. He began draining the oil. My car was left alone for a while. Then the service manager did his inspection, then came to me and said my suspension shocks were at the end of its life. Replacement was $1580. He used scare tactics, such as your car has high miles with 170k miles, and they were supposed to only last 70k. I refused my car drives just fine. He said I needed new engine air filter for $24.99. I waited a bit before answering, his face was hopeful. He asked if I want it, I said no, then he just walked away with a mad-disappointed face. Sorry, but I can change my own air filters, which I have at home. The technician took another 10 minutes to change the oil filter, and then put in the oil. My car was done. I went into the clerk's office and waited 10 minutes before I was able to pay. Though I won't blame her for the slow service she was on the phone with another customer. All in all, I got there at 8:03AM, I was finally able to get out at 8:45AM. I did stand by my car the whole time to watch them and I inspected my car afterwards.

They agree, take the car in the garage for about 20-30 mins and come back in to tell us that her car doesn't take synthetic blend oil and we would have to pay for full synthetic.

READ the signs posted above the bays BEFORE you instinctively decide to take the shorter line. SOMETIMES, the longer line goes faster because it is for cars that are younger than 10 years old. READ the signs first! #3. Be prepared to get out of your car when you pull in to the bay. They need to get in your car to hook up the device that reads your car's computer. BE PREPARED. Have your card ready. #4. Don't wait until the last minute! Go BEFORE your expiration date, like on the 17th of the month or the 10th. I kicked this review down to #3 because the station at 16th street handled a bigger crowd more efficiently.

Even though we could almost put the bumper back in its designated slots, it soon became evident that the bumper would flare out again even more at high freeway speeds--especially in windy conditions. So I showed the damaged bumper to the service tech at Cadillac of Las Vegas, and he referred me to AW Collision, alerting me that repairs would probably cost over $2,000, because I likely needed a new front bumper. I quickly drove the vehicle to AW Collision, and was informed that if a new bumper was ordered, it would have to be repainted, because Cadillac bumpers just come in basic black color. With a three-part painting process needed to blend in new paint with the car's existing unusual deep amethyst metallic color, this sounded like a nightmare to me. But not to worry! The exterior bumper sustained no visible damage--not even cosmetic. Only an out of sight fastener had been ripped,. And after a physical inspection estimator Theresa told me that a skilled technician on staff could repair the existing bumper with plastic soldering, and the car would look like new. She was friendly and professional, and I was ultimately given a very reasonable written estimate for recommended repairs that totaled just under $500. I scheduled an appointment for service, left the car for just 2-1/2 days, and when I picked it up it had been washed with care and indeed looked just like new.

Finally the manager shows up and barely says a word but they will take care of it. So again two more days to fix it. HAHA, again they did crappy work.

Our brand new, 2-hour old Cadillac SRX (t-boned by a hit & run driver) was towed to this shop as recommended by Cadillac of Las Vegas on April 18th. Our vehicle was not driveable so we knew that we were going to need a rental car which was fine. Things started out okay, and our point of contact was Enrique who was very polite and cordial and kept us up to date via phone and emails. The adjuster went to look at the vehicle and approved the quote, our insurance company sent them a check within 3 business days and they were able to get the parts ordered. We also knew from the start that it was going to take a week to get the new door and quarter panel as they were on back order. The parts came in and we were told by Enrique that the vehicle would be ready at the very latest on May 16th. Well, everything started to go downhill from there. AW then started working on the vehicle and when they finally cut into it they found that there was further damage and that the adjuster needed to come out again to approve some further charges and request another check. Enrique then said the vehicle was going in to paint on Friday the 17th and he thought we would be able to pick it up May 22nd or 23rd. When we didn't hear back from Enrique we called and were told he was on vacation for the rest of the week and now the vehicle wouldn't be ready until after Memorial Day. After the holiday weekend we were told the vehicle had to be brought to the dealership to have the suspension repaired and it would only take a day or two and then back to AW for final detailing. When we didn't hear back we called Cadillac and were told that AW forgot to order some parts. Cadillac felt bad that we were now going to have to wait another week for the extra parts so they gave us a loaner to use. So, we turned our rental car in which cost us $975, our insurance only covers a max of $750. We spoke to Enrique and he told us that he would speak with the adjuster and they could get the charges rolled in to the additional work and we could take that overage off our $1000 deductible. The vehicle was finally repaired by the dealership and delivered back to AW on June 3rd. We called AW on Monday June 6th and were told the vehicle was ready but before we could pick it up, they needed final paperwork from our insurance company. Come to find out our insurance company was awaiting paperwork from AW. The vehicle ended up sitting there ready to go for the entire week and we were finally able to pick it up on Saturday, June 11th, almost 2 months. I forgot to mention that for over a week we were unable to reach Enrique and were now told that we had a new contact named Tom. We spoke to Tom a couple of times on the phone prior to coming in. We told him what Enrique said about the extra $225 we paid for the rental car and he said there was nothing they could do about it. When we arrived on Saturday to pick up the vehicle I wanted to look over the vehicle with he and the manager Ozzie but they wanted to collect the payment instead. We chose to pay cash and Tom made a snide remark about this being a cashless society, very rude. I complained about the extra rental car charges, as this was all there fault we were delayed since they forgot to order parts and didn't do the work when they promised to. Tom again said there wasn't anything he could do and when I got upset, Ozzie gave us 50% of it back. The entire time Tom was just rude and brash. He told us they washed the car the day before but it rained so they didn't have time to wash it again before we picked it up. We don't think it was ever washed, the dust on the entire vehicle was very thick and heavy. This was also a new vehicle and the inside was pristine when we received it from Cadillac. When we picked it up from AW there were several dents in the leather and grease on the light colored interior, very, very upsetting!

Please keep in mind that I am a small business owner and I am always in support of small businesses. We purchased a deal for two on Living Social, and of course tried to call and schedule a time for our tour. We were a group of 5 and purchased two deals with the intent of paying full price for the 5th. From the 1st conversation, the owner Kim seemed a little upset that we were using the voucher. The rule was no more than two per group, so we weren\\'t asking for anything special. She went on to talk about how the voucher is causing her to lose money and so on. She was very nice and as a fellow business owner I could see her point of view. As a customer it was highly inappropriate for her to mention that. If she was losing money, she should have removed it from Living Social. We finally schedule and agree to pay the $50 for them to pick us up. Again, Kim was very nice and I thought she was great. This was my first time riding along with one other in the group so we were a little nervous. She reassured that the tour leader would go at our pace. During the ride Kim received a phone call from someone who we later found out was her son. In his defense he did not know he was on speaker phone, but still he asked were there any fat people and were there any hard asses. Now I get the need to know sizes to make sure you have the right equipment but that was highly unprofessional and could have been worded very differently. Kim did let him know that he was on speaker after that and the convo went on to progress about what bikes he needed to pull. Already we were all being patient by not addressing what was said. When we get to the site, the son Jim had a horrible attitude. Once we got on our bikes and he started his instructions he started out with \"I\\'m a lenient guy but don\\'t piss me off\". There was no reason at all for this unprofessionalism. He went on to explain he sprained his ankle and he was clearly in pain. For whatever reason he wore his flip flops. I\\'m not a professional, but I know that is not the proper shoe to wear for ATV. With all that being said, as a business owner, I would have explained that the tour could not happen due to an injury, and refunded the money problem solved. Instead they decided to push forward. Still no one in the group addressed the nasty attitude and language used. We started on a trial course; during the course one of the novelists was having trouble clearly. Instead of really working with her, he shouted out directions and we began the trail soon after. About 10 minutes in an ATV flipped over. I was in front so I don\\'t what happened exactly. Someone stopped abruptly on a hill and it rolled. The ATV and rider appeared fine and we kept pushing on for about 35 more minutes. During this ride, apparently Jim was yelling behind him \"tell him to knock it the fuck off\". If you are addressing a problem you should stop and address it with that person. We were never told that we had to stay in the same position as when we started out. We were told no racing, no doughnuts and that was fine. We had two couples together so when one of the girls would fall behind, her significant other would slow to make sure they were ok. We were then told the tour was cut short because we weren\\'t listening by not staying in line. The group was addressed once as a whole when the bike was rolled and that was it. Never once were we told that we had to stay in one single file line and not change. I am a very quiet person and if I\\'m wrong I will never try to argue against it. But, obviously Jim didn\\'t want to be out there and used any excuse to cut his day short. It didn\\'t make sense that this is how they would treat customers and it came back to the Living Social Voucher. This is where I began to get upset and I explained that I will be writing a review about our experience and I gave her the same advice I added in this review. If you can\\'t be professional at work stay home. This sat her off and words begin to exchange, this was the first time I noted Kim being unprofessional which shocked me. Once I told her what her son said she began to get upset with him because I said it was all going in the review. At some point her husband showed up and begins yelling and screaming and it was just a very bad scene that could have escalated so much more. Needless to say we had a horrible experience all because someone was having a bad and painful day. I can empathize with that truly, and he was clearly in pain. But someone should have decided that instead trying to collect that money; they should have cancelled the tour in the beginning and called it a day. Sorry for the long review, I tried to cut it short, but I wanted to be fairto the business. The trail was nice and Kim was great up until the end.

Our guide was James, who\\'s the son the of the business owner. Incredible guy. Very knowledgeable, helpful and an all round fun guy to be around. He picked us up from our hotel and took us to the shop to complete some paperwork, then drove us to the terrain. TBH, it\\'s a little on the expensive side but that\\'s because it\\'s Vegas. The other guide, Richard, was also very cool. The ride itself was amazing. It took me about 10 minutes to get adjusted to the manually geared ATV (which is more fun than the automatic one\\'s), but once the learning curve was over it was sheer enjoyment. The bumps are what makes the whole thing fun. A couple of members of the group slowed us down somewhat but that\\'s to be expected in a group. James leads the group and Richard brings up the rear. Both are experienced riders and always keep an eye out on the group. James is really good at it. He seems to have eyes at the back of his head, because he can spot issues with the most distant, last rider and rushes back to help. To be able to keep an eye out like that on the entire group is not easy. Be careful with the ATV\\'s because if you break a taillight or something you\\'ll have to pay for it. But, if you follow the rules and once you get used to the bumpy ride, you should be fine. After the group tour was over, the 4 of us requested James to take us out for another hour along a different trail. He was very tired, obviously, but still agreed and gave us a good deal with the additional fees. He took us along a trail we really enjoyed and could speed on. He and Richard never forgot that even though if was just the 4 of us they were taking out, our safety was still their concern. He even managed to pick a part of a trail where we sighted some big horn mountain sheep. Tame creatures. Most unbothered about human companions.

The experience was fantastic! Above All is certainly a family run establishment, with a similar look and feel, but don\\'t let that drive you elsewhere. Kim, the proprietor, runs a tight ship, with great tour guides, well maintained equipment, and low prices. When I first talked to Kim, it took her a while to convince me that a \"guided tour\" would be exciting. But, after experiencing it first hand, I can tell you that when she says \"guided tour\", she doesn\\'t mean putting along learning about wildlife and taking pictures of blooming cacti (although, I\\'m sure you could ask for it). Our guide James, who formerly competed in motocross, took us over the trails best suited to our abilities, as fast as we could manage. - I have not driven an ATV in a long time, and many in our party had never operated one, but we were still flying along. To give you an idea of what to expect on a guided tour (You can also just rent an ATV without a tour). Once you get into Above All ATV, you will need to fill out some waivers and pay. Afterwards, you may either follow your guide in your own car or ride in the guide\\'s car out to the tour site. (In our case, we followed the guide in our own car, which meant we got to leave as soon as we were done riding, instead of waiting for the guide to clean and shelve our equipment.) At the tour site, the guide asked us for our ATV preferences, and brought out a few models. We were then given safety equipment (gloves, helmet, goggles), iced water, and instructions as to how to operate the different vehicles. To warm-up, we spent about 10 minutes doing loops on a practice course. Finally, we left for the canyon. While riding through the canyon, our tour guide was impeccable: He somehow managed to keep riding while repeatedly looking back to check on us no matter how fast we were going. He clearly knew the trails like the back of his hand and chose them so they got increasingly more challenging. In the beginning of the ride, when we were still adjusting, he used his ATV to skillfully pick-off large rocks from the trail that would cause us problems. Occasionally during the ride, we would pause to take water breaks and enjoy the scenery long enough to regain blood flow to our arms and legs. At the end of the tour, we were given more refreshing water, and clean, ice-cold towelettes - which made it easier to see the huge smiles hidden behind the dirt on our faces. While I haven\\'t tried the other Las Vegas ATV offerings, and therefore don\\'t have a great base of comparison, I must say that I cannot imagine having had a better time. Kim, James, and the staff at Above All were fantastic. Beyond the review I have two tips: 1. If you want to drive something fast, off-road, forget about the dune-buggies, they\\'re unreliable. Go ATVing instead. 2. After ATVing, you will be sore (maybe for a few days), so plan out your trip accordingly.', 'positive'], ['Yalp — Above All Las Vegas ATV Tours & Watercraft Rentals', 'For our anniversary a few years back, we decided to rent ATV\\'s and go out riding.

Anyway I call ace they get the car and tell me it will be another 400 dollars to fix what just broke, which was the coolant reservoir. Unbeknownst to me the whole reason the car over heated and busted the coolant tank was because the hose they made to the hydraulic fan tank was leaking. They put in a new coolant tank gave me back the car and told me it was good. The next morning I found out about the leak and confronted them about it. They had looked the car over and gave it back to me without even realizing a part THEY put on was leaking. They were kind enough to fix the leak and seemed contrite. But when I asked for my 400 dollars back for paying for the new coolant tank seeing as how it was their negligence that caused the car to over heat and bust that reservoir. They said it was an old tank and that was the only reason it busted. I later went to the lincoln dealership and they confirmed my suspicions. ACE automotive caused my car to overheat because they didn't have a hose fully fastened and when I needed it fixed they charged me for it. I have taken my car, my girlfriends car, my mom, my sister and even my grandma's car there.

Ever since SRS Customs (Dave lays down one of the most beautiful weld beads I have ever seen and I had him fabricate a custom mandrel bent exhaust on another car) near downtown closed down due to the economy, I have been in search of another shop. The issue I had was an exhaust leak on one of the aftermarket downpipes on my AMG 63. Since this is an AMG, I am VERY particular on the workmanship. I was referred to another shop from a car forum (cannot Yelp it because they must be under a different name and using a DBA) perform the work that had sub par welds (used a 110v MIG welder that could barely penetrate the stainless steel) and still leaked at the manifold. I took it back to that shop twice and they still couldn\\'t resolve the issue and wanted me to leave the car overnight. Hell no! From another referral, I was led to Advance Mufflers over on Rancho between Cheyenne and Craig. I met Tony, one of the technicians before the shop opened and we just talked cars. I found out that he was formerly a fabricator at a muscle car header manufacturer (forgot which company) in SoCal. We talked about header prototyping, welds, and my current situation. After our brief conversation, I felt comfortable with his knowledge and experience. Especially, since my issue wasn\\'t a complex one. Within 3 hours, he had my downpipe removed, the flange repaired (the other shop damaged it in their attempt to rectify the situation), reposition the upper O2 sensor bung for the wideband sensor, bolted up, aligned the pipe and welded it back together. Since I liked his welds so much, I also had him redo the other downpipe. I will be coming back for them to install my X-pipe once it arrives.

Professionalism: All customers should be treated professionally, which means the use of competence or skill expected of the professional. Professionalism shows the customer they're cared for.

However, it's the one that isn't that is more inline with my experience there. The one star review wasn't there when I first researched Bison, only the 4 and 5 star ones. It sounded too good to be true. And, in fact, it was. Not too good, just not true. First off let's start with the website. If you visit the Bison website, it lends a very upscale impression with both it's writing and graphics. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. This is a Mom and Pop backyard operation, albeit from a large metal building in Matt's backyard. Disorder, dust, and disarray are the theme inside and outside the shop. His teen-aged daughter or wife will run your credit card for the amount due. I have never actually met Matt, the owner, only spoke to him on the phone as he was never there. He is pleasant and courteous enough on the phone, until you begin to voice dissatisfaction. Then he simply does not answer your calls. But enough on that. I was so impressed by the reviews that I brought 2 vehicles to Bison for repair. The first had a coolant leak and a busted motor mount and an issue with the transmission that turned out to be a shift module, a part that sells for around $150.00. That was the most expensive part replaced on the vehicle, but somehow I racked up a bill of over $900.00. After picking up the vehicle I called Matt and told him I could still smell antifreeze. He assured me that in a short time the smell would go away. It has been several months now and the smell is still prevalent, and the vehicle still requires additional antifreeze to be added periodically. I will say to their credit the motor mount and the transmission were fixed correctly. These are very straightforward repairs, and it seems in those cases they are able enough. The motor and transmission did not have to be removed to perform repairs on them. So how did I rack up $900.00? There is no work order to itemize repairs, as Yelp reviewer Andrew C. mentioned in his review. Curious how none of the other reviews mentioned this. Vehicle #2 had overheating issues and an air conditioner problem. The air was fixed, the overheating kind of fixed, it overheats less frequently now. This is not an old car, it's a 2011 model that we bought new. When the vehicle was returned, there was a warning light on that was not on when we dropped the car off. It was a bad battery warning light. I had purchased a new battery from AAA two years prior, and they have an excellent warranty. AAA came to my home, checked the battery and said it was marginal, so they replaced it free of charge. However, this did not make the warning light go out. I called Matt back and asked when I could bring the car back so they could fix the problem they caused, and he informed me they were very busy, and it was very hot inside the shop. After that, he quit answering my calls, as Yelp reviewer Andrew C. also mentioned. This time the bill was north of $750.00. In closing I would just say that you can do better elsewhere.

I test drove 8-10 different cars to make sure I knew what qualities were important to me. I decided on the Volkswagen GTI, and I found what I thought was the perfect car - right color, right miles, right features - on Cars.com at Bobby Rahal\\'s dealership in Wexford, PA. The dealership was a distance away, but I figured that it was worth inquiring about. So, I did... I called the number on the ad, and Dave DeRose was the salesperson to reach back out to me via text message the following day. Dave and I spoke about the car, and he convinced me that the car was well worth the 5 hour drive to get to Wexford from Maryland. I asked him for his honesty, and said that I didn\\'t want any surprises... I wanted to know that the car was going to be exactly as described, and there wasn\\'t anything that I should be aware of before making the trip. Dave\\'s exact words were, \"Not in the least. The car is perfect, except for a little curb rash on one wheel and my guy is here now fixing it. I called him when you committed to purchase. I\\'m standing beside it right now. Our dealership does not sell anything that we would put our reputation on the line for.\" So, I was convinced. I trusted Dave. I thought, \"Well, he\\'s confident, so that makes me feel confident\". I had him send over the paperwork; I signed them and sent them right back. The following day, I called my bank and had them wire over the funds for the full amount of the car. I thought, \"I have nothing to worry about\". Wow, was I wrong! My boyfriend and I arrived at the dealership on Saturday afternoon. I had been texting with Dave for the past few days, so I was excited to meet him, and thank him for his fantastic service. As we were pulling up, I receive a text from Dave, saying that he called out sick that day, but in his words, \"All is ready to go\". At the time, I didn\\'t think much of it. I walked into the dealership, filled with anticipation - this is the first car that I had ever really sought out... I had inquired, researched, and negotiated the deal all by myself, and that was a big thing for me! I was so happy and excited to bring my new car home with me, and to show it off to my family and friends whom I had spent the past few days bragging with. Brandon Collins, the pre-owned sales manager, met us and had the car pulled around. We went out to the car, and a cloud of disappointment flushed over me. This \"perfect\" car not only had the worst curb rash I\\'d ever seen on a wheel, but also had a large, approximately 16\", scrape above the tire, as well as on the rear door handle. There was also a crack on the right turning signal light. As we continued to inspect the car, the damages kept mounting. There was a quarter-sized crack in the windshield, there was a large crack on the interior driver-side door, there was water inside the center console, indicating that the sun roof may have a leak. We were outwardly upset. I couldn\\'t believe this was happening! My perfect car was a fraud! Dave had lied, and because he had called out that day, Brandon was left to take the heat. Needless to say, we left without a car that day, but what I can say is that Brandon made the best out of the worst situation.

I didn\\'t break it 2. My car was in their care while it was being serviced 3. He admitted fault.

He stated that he would speak to the store manager to get his statement and requested pictures of the damaged part.

Timothy called back (yet another day later) and stated that after speaking with the store manager, he agreed with him, that it was general wear and tear of the vehicle and stated that the best he could do is what the store manager, John, offered me...\"FREE installation\" of the part, which he stated would be at least an hour and a half of labor (for a part that would literally take 15-20 minutes to install) and I\\'d have to pay for the part that his employee broke. He didn\\'t care that they admitted fault or that he made this decision using an inaccurate depiction of the damaged part. I later called back to see if he would at least approve for me to have the part installed at a different store, as I didn\\'t feel comfortable going back to the store where I felt mistreated and taken advantage of.

They also inspect fluid levels, tire tread/wear, battery performance, shocks, plus other checks as a part of the service. After the service, they sat down with me to go over the findindgs. I liked the fact they were not pressuring me in any way to have the findings correct; they just factually reviewed the results. I feel I can trust them. Another reason why I feel this way, C&R said the tires were ok based on the tire measurements. Another tire company, earlier in the day, had also measured the tires and said that the tread on two of the tires was low and needed to be replaced. C&R said the tires have another 5-10k miles left. Another thing I like is they have a Master Tech that has been trained on Acuras. This tech can do most of what the Acura dealers. Lastly, I like the fact they are AAA Approved. Not many auto repair places have that approval because the process of getting approved is very rigorous and they do need to respond to and correct/resolve, as applicable, issues that customers raise as a part of keepng AAA Aproval.

First off go to the Henderson location. They have a pretty large store and pretty much have mostly everything you need. I went to the Las Vegas Camping World and it was so small. I went there because I had a $20.00 coupon I needed to use, so I went in to buy RV step covers. They had them, but they were higher than the internet price. There were 2 sales people there, one girl who had short black hair and had tattoos up and down her arms, and a guy who looked like he just did not care to be there. She told me that she could give me the internet price, but she would have to charge me the shipping also. I looked at her in disbelief. She said it is better to pay the price they had posted, it would be cheaper. So I bought them and a tire gauge. I used my $20.00 coupon and got in my car. Something made me call the Henderson Las Vegas Camping World and talked to a service tech who just happened to answer the phone, he looked up the price online and said that the store will print out the sale page on the internet and give the price the internet has, no problem. I tried to return my RV Step covers and the tattooed girl said she could only give me back the money for the RV Step covers and would not give me the $20.00 coupon. She said to go to the Henderson Store and they would credit me because I was in the system and when they pull up my Good Sam membership the transaction will appear. So I guess I will be going back tomorrow. I can not believe that Camping World would condone this kind of service, including all the other bad reviews. Anyone who goes to this store who could be a potential Good Sam member would just walk out and never go into a Camping World again.

It came out that they told me all the brakes are really in bad condition and should be replaced immediately or I will have a bad accident. They wanted to install new brake pads and new rotors, making it a 1300$ bill. I returned to the seller, he was confused, said the breaks should be fine. We had a little bit of an argument and did not stay friends in the end, he went down with the price a few hundred $, feeling bad at me, and I felt I paid too much. Anyway I decided not to do the repair at Camping World, because they are so slow there doing their work, I decided to do it later, eventually when the brakes start to make some noise. Was driving for 3 months, nothing happened. Was driving 10.000 Miles, nothing, brakes are fine. 8 Months later I finally thought myself that these breaks might be at their end now. I made an appointment at a small brake shop (P&O brakes in Las Vegas) - he had a quick look and said: Well your breaks are still fine, the are not even half used. Maybe one pad on the back is thinner, but still no problem. So - what on earth was the Camping World staff talking about 8 months ago? Why do they lie to their first time customers? I really would never go there to do a repair. I know, many people go, their service lane is always full. These people have too much money to spend. Small business are much better, you talk to reliable people, you get a better price, you do not have to talk to a lady at the front desk which does not have any clue about where your motorhome is at the moment and if it will take another 5 minutes, 5 hours or 5 days.

This review is for the latest. I am so beyond furious right now. A couple months ago we took our car in to get fixed. There were apparently multiple fixes, each coming in at a higher price, but what could I do, I needed my car fixed, so I approved the fixes. Going in to pick up my car when it was done I was surprised by the cost. It was almost 50% higher than what was quoted. I was floored and learned that when he was quoted me prices he never included the labor price, just parts. Who does that! I've never had a mechanic quote me just parts not labor! But what could I do, I paid it and left, knowing I wouldn't be back. Unfortunately that was not the case. Starting my car for the first time to leave that parking lot I noticed something was wrong. My car was shaking so bad. It was worse than when I brought it in. When we tried bringing it back in and my husband explained the shaking, they had the nerve to tell him that that's how cars are, they shake when they are cool and just had to warm up. How stupid did they think we were! One of their repairs was the motor mounts and my husband pointed out to them that it's probably the motor mounts.

This takes me to today. Last week after I filled my gas tank, I smelled gas and noticed that my tank had leaked. So I finally took it to another mechanic to have them look at that and the rough ride the car had. My fuel tank wasn't properly connected to the fuel pump which was the cause for the gas spilling out every time I drove it. Which is another thing Desert Heat had replaced and couldn't seem to connect properly after replacing it! As for the rough ride, can you guess what that was? It was the motor mounts!! I need new motor mounts! The motor mounts that were used were so cheap they had already broken! I'm so beyond pissed right now at this mechanic I'm having a hard time containing myself.

I have used them for almost all of our auto repairs and maintenance and have always been very satisfied with the quality of work and the reasonable prices. However today I came in and didn't recognize anyone there. Everyone seemed friendly enough so I didn't have any concerns. I was told the driver side door latch needed to be maintained not replaced and the driver side electric window motor was dead. I was charged $238.00 total when the part itself costs between $37.00 (carid.com) and $53.00 (amazon.com). This means I was charged between $201.00 and $185.00 to remove the door panel, grease the lock and install the window motor. I have removed door panels before which takes between 10-20 minutes tops. I have never installed a window motor, but I expect it to be a 30 minute job with another 10-20 minutes to grease the lock and put the door panel back on. I think a more fair and reasonable price would have been closer to $150.00 rather than almost $250.00. None of this is really a catastrophe, but I didn't appreciate my car smelling like a tobacco factory caught on fire when I picked it up. I refuse to give them a 2-3 star rating simply because this could be an anomaly and if Kevin and Kurt are still involved I am willing to give the place another chance.

Drive time was my last resort before I gave up on getting a car. I came in on Friday afternoon just to look around and see what my options were. I ended up working with Toby and he was professional, patient and answered all questions I had. I told him I prefer a Honda Civic or maybe a VW Jetta.

I was shown a cute Acura but it had leather seats and it was very hot that day so sitting inside the car let me know, leather seats are not for me. The second car he shown me was a 2016 Honda Civic EX. The car was exactly what I wanted! It comes with more than what I thought I wanted and also the payment was much smaller than anything I was offered at other dealerships. Also, my interest rate offered by Drive time was almost 10% lower than other offers. The problem with the other dealer offers was that the car they told me I could get was NOT worth the high payment they wanted. The Civic I purchased from Drive Time a few days ago has remote start and that alone sold me because being pregnant in this summer heat, being able to cool my car before getting in it Is a true benefit. I mean, I have had no problems with my car so far and it drives very smooth and was not high mileage, 30,560 was what the odometer read. I personally am glad I gave this place a try and have told a few people I know about it. Also, yes I did put money down. I was approved for a $400 down payment but since I wanted lower monthly payments and I was getting a settlement from a car accident in my 2006 Civic Hybrid, I decided to be much more down.

I gave it 1 star cause 0 or minus stars is not optional.Stay away from this place as far away as you possibly can. See my photographs! I truly believe that every day they pick up Mexicans standing by the Home Depot to paint their cars. My first contact was with one of the two guys running the shop, I believe it was the manager, and he gave me an estimate of $500 to paint my hood, front bumper, and blend in the side panels. It is common sense to do the panels when you paint hood/bumper. They were not planning on removing the bumper to paint it. Again, common sense prevails, in order to get it done right is to remove the bumper so that the paint don't chip/crack from the edges. I told him to remove the bumper, and I was willing to pay extra just to get it done right, and they charged me little more, but I was good with that as long as they do the job right. I left my car for about a week, and when I picked it up the bumper had smudges on it, and was cracking on the edges. They did not blend in the side panel, and you could tell the color did not match the hood, and bumper. They never removed the bumper completely, they removed it partially by ripping it off the screw/clips, which caused additional damage to the plastic radiator core inside of the hood above the bumper, which is attached to the hood-prop-rod. They just left the plastic broken, and the attached hood-prop-rod completely detached from the radiator core. BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY JUST SHOVED THE HOOD-PROP-ROD (not attached to anything) IN BETWEEN THE BUMPER, AND RADIATOR. To replace the part it cost me $450, not including labor. When they removed the bumper they broke the holes for the screws/clips on the side of the bumper, which are now missing, and the bumper wasn't perfectly aligned with the side panels. They never attached the grill on top of the bumper, and just left with only the top part attached to the broken radiator core. They didn't cover the carpet inside of the vehicle, and left paint on from stepping on it. I THOUGHT I WAS ON A HIDDEN CAMERA SHOW, and thought that this was a JOKE. I was just waiting for someone to come out and tell me that this was a joke. I complained about it to the manager guy that gave me an estimate, and to another guy that's possibly the owner. I told them about the issue, and especially pointed out the damage, and told him that the side panels have not been blended in. Even though the owner wasn't present during the original estimate he told me we didn't think I wanted the panels done. I can't emphasize enough how many times I told them what I needed done, DONE RIGHT, plus it's common sense every professional shop will tell you that the side panels always need to be blended in, or otherwise the paint job will not look right. He told me that its common for the radiator core and the hood-prop-rod to break because it's common on these cars, a 2014 vw Jetta. He blamed it on the manufacturer LOL. OK, I GET IT, EVEN IF! You F...... broke it, NOT ME. It broke while it was in your possession. I felt like I was talking to 2 IDIOTS. U should know this as someone that claims is running a professional paint shop. AGAIN, I didn't make a scene because they offered to fix it, but told me that I would have to pay additional $200 for the side panels cause they never included it in the estimate. LIE! I just wanted to get it done, and left the vehicle for another week. I just wanted to get it over with, and never return to this place again. The owner guy told me this time he will paint it, and get it don't right. I picked it up the next week, AND GUESS WHAT? Few days later a piece of paint from the hood came off. I wasted so much time, money fixing the broken parts, and other small stuff that it would have been cheaper for me to just take it to a REAL PROFESSIONAL BODY SHOP TO GET IT DONE RIGHT. Lesson learned. If it's a cheap paint job it's most likely going to be a shitty job. Please check out the pictures I attached to see the damage they caused. Now my bumper is barely hanging on to the front, and I had to use zip ties to keep it from falling off since all the hardware/screw/clips are missing.\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — Earl Scheib Paint & Body', \"I love how my car turned out!

This is a review of a shop that is for someone more on a budget, and not necessarily asking for a Barrett Jackson show car level of a paint job, though they still do a good job. For most people, I think this Earl Scheib would be just fine. That said, when I was there I saw quite a few classic cars parked in their lot, waiting for a paint job, so I would have say enough people must think they do good enough job to feel comfortable enough to go there and have their mustangs and camaros painted there. Now, for my experience. I picked up a used fiberglass camper shell for my truck, that had scuffed corners from being stored on end. The camper was dark gray, while my truck is white. I took it to Earl Scheib, and they painted it white for me, and the price came in at about $300. The good: 1. They were able to match the color white to my truck's factory white paint. You wouldn't have known the camper was gray. It is as white as my truck's factory paint is. There is no gray showing through the paint or any missed spots. You would think this camper was originally white to begin with. 2. They were fast, and had it done within a day. 3. I was on a budget, and couldn't afford to have the corners repaired with filler. The paint shop was able to spray it with a thick primer, and I think they even hit the corners a little extra to help fill in the damage on the corners. When I got it back, the corners looked almost like they had filled it with some body filler,a dn was very pleased with how they did that. I am convinced it would not have looked that much better with body filler. SO this saved me almost a $100. 4. The guys at the shop were very courteous and helpful. and they even helped me put the camper on the back of my truck at no charge. Some places charge for that. 5. After two years, the paint has not peeled or bubbled. It also came with a guarantee that if it ever did, they would reshoot it. 6. They taped off the windows and molding so there was no overspray on the glass or molding. What could have been better: 1. when I looked closer, it looks as though there are some air bubbles on the finish from back when the paint was still wet in some spots. They are very tiny and you have to look close to notice them. Now, to be fair, it is possible if I had this camper wet sanded, or possibly even just cut and polished by a detail shop, these imperfections might be removed, or reduced. I may end up doing this, but these imperfections don't bother me that much. Besides, for $300, I can't complain. There are some places that charge over $1000 to paint a camper shell. Bottom line, I would recommend Earl Scheib. I am considering taking my car there to be painted.\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — Earl Scheib Paint & Body', 'I almost got taken for as a fool buy this place.

No big deal as I was in no major rush and just happy he could do it same day. Understood issues that might have taken him a bit more time than expected, too. I keep my car pretty clean regurlary as I am an UBER Driver and need to keep it looking nice.

Alfred cleaned these cars within about 2 hours for $160 (including tip). When I found his information, I called and he answered promptly. He gave me a general idea of how much the detail would cost, but explained that it was best to give the quote upon arrival (just in case the car was in worse shape than described). I understood this, so he set up a time to stop by that evening when my husband came home in order to provide the quote. It was the day before Good Friday, so my husband came home early. We called Alfred and he told us he had the time to clean the cars that day, rather than waiting for the next day. He quoted us ahead of time: $55 for my husband's Camry, $75 for my BMW (with extra attention on my dirty wheels). We asked how we could pay and he said cash is best - but I believe this means he also takes credit - so we ran out to the ATM. He arrived in good time, shook our hands and was very friendly. He did let us know that he would normally charge a bit more for our cars because we have a dog who we travel with often. Even with our backseat hammocks, his fur gets stuck on the carpet and in the crevices, which takes a little extra effort for Alfred to remove. He told us he wouldn't charge more because he had already quoted us, which I really appreciated. His van is decked out! He has so much amazing equipment (most of which our cars didn't really need), but it goes to show the variety of situations he is prepared for from the back of the van. Our vehicles are aged 10 years apart, but he had everything he needed to properly handle both levels of quality. All we had to do is leave the vehicles outside (we live in an apartment/condo complex) and he had everything necessary to complete his work - as you would expect from a 100% mobile detail company. We checked on him once while walking our dog - the cars looked FANTASTIC and he wasn't even finished. Once he was finished, he gave us a call. Upon inspecting the vehicles we were pleasantly surprised at the level of detail he put into cleaning our vehicles. He really made them 'shine'. Afterwards, while he was cleaning up his supplied and packing the van, he made small talk. We are new to the area, so he recommended some trips we could take (Hoover Dam), some nicer areas to move (away from the strip) if we were looking to settle down, and also a good real estate agent for our future needs. All in all, I felt like he did a great job on our cars as well as building a business relationship with us for the long term. We keep our cars extremely clean; outside of the dog hair, we never leave trash, we don't eat in the car and we wipe up messes as soon as they may happen. The only reason our cars were this bad is because they had been transported from Florida a few months ago. I say this to point out that if you keep your car really junky - with trash bags worth of crap everywhere - don't be surprised if you get a higher quote. Either way, whether you have a 1990s hooptie or a Bentley, Alfred can bring your vehicle back from the brink of death with all his amazing tools and his general knowledge from years in the business.

I went for a brakes job because they were pulsating at this time; I left the car there for evaluation. They called me and recommended to change all the rotors on four wheels and so forth, to which I accepted. I also asked for Transmission flush, which they were please to perform. All these cost $799.99, which was fine. They recommended to work on my front axles for $421 to which I said no, thanks.

He ended up waiting 2 hours for this simple oil change to be done. No other checks were done on the vehicle at all. That leads me into my next encounter I had on January 26, 2016. I had actually called the day before because I discovered a nail in my side wall and I wanted them to confirm I needed it replaced and to order my new tire for me like they needed to last time. I felt with Rick, he confirmed a new tire was needed and set an appt for me in the morning while my two older boys were at school and I would only have my 10 mo old with me and it would be before his nap time. The original appt was set for 9:30. I arrived and Adam told me that Rick should have set it for a later time as the delivery of the tire wouldn\\'t be until between the time of 10:30am and 12pm. So I had to plan to come back around my sons nap time. I came back about 11:30 because I also needed a balance as I was experiencing some shaking while driving on the freeway, figured they would get started on that if the tire hadn\\'t arrived yet. They didn\\'t. I ended up being there for over 2 hours... And this is after making an appt and making the effort I did the day before to avoid all this wait. Very frustrating. They replaced my rear tire and I asked them to check for an oil leak as I had some spots in my garage from my truck. They couldn\\'t find a leak... But I found it funny that I had spots in my garage from the last time THEY performed the oil change and after that day there were no more leaks. They must have tightened the oil pan... I checked because I laid down a large white poster from the dollar store under my truck and there are no more oil leaks... So at least that\\'s fixed... Well I waited for over 2 hours... I watched off and on from the waiting area by the bathroom... I thought it was weird that the guys were out there in the bay smoking while working... Maybe things would go faster if they didn\\'t have to take breaks to light up. And during this time they said it was about done and I asked if they had balanced all tires and they said they would get it done... What was I waiting on?? Why weren\\'t they all balanced like I asked. Anyway, dealing with all that and a fussy baby because it was his nap time was no good! I don\\'t drive on the hwy or freeway often... My boys go to school about 2.5-3 miles away from where we live, which also happens to be 83rd ave and deer valley. Just to give you an idea of how much I drive. Well last weekend we decided to go to dinner at Bobby Q\\'s off I-17 and the front of my truck was shaking way worse than it was before I got the \"balance\" done. Everything was rattling and it was very scary! Especially because I have my 3 small boys that I drive around. My husband was also very concerned saying the balance should have fixed any shaking going on. He told me to take it back in. I called the next morning and made an appt for today, Wednesday Feb 10th, 2016. I had an appt for 10am to have the tires balanced again. They said t would take about an hour. So I walked to Albertsons with my now 11 mo old and grabbed a few groceries we needed. I got back and waited a bit and by this time it had been almost an hour as I had dropped off my keys at 9:49 and it was almost 10:45 for them to come inside and tell me that my two front tires needed to be replaced because the inside of the tires were so worn down.... What????? I\\'ve been here 3 different visits prior to today, all long visits at that for them to tell me that now I need two new front tires?? Why is this just now being brought up? Why wasn\\'t it mentioned when I got the tires \"balanced\" last time? Or why wasn\\'t it brought up when there was a guy changin my oil and could see my tread was wearing down? That\\'s a sales opportunity first of all and a safety issue!!!! That\\'s your job to find and let the customer know if there is an issue. There was never any mention of my front tires from any of my previous visits... I still have all my receipts and what has been done along with any notes... Not one word was mentioned about my tires inner tread getting low or them recommending I need a rotation or anything... My front left tire measured 1/32..... That\\'s BAD! And it was on the inner side of the tire, so it\\'s not exactly where you can see it on a normal regular basis. But they have been up under my truck including today, 4 times. And I\\'m just now being told this. Also while they took me out there to show me the inner tread of my front tires, I\\'m holding my baby and the guy talking to me lights up a cigarette two feet away from me and my baby inside the bay??!!!!!!!!

They didn't reset my car's oil change maintenance mileage counter. So as soon as I started it, my car told me it was time for an another oil change. They reset it once I asked them to do it. Not a big deal, but customers shouldn't have to ask - right? Their windshield sticker said to come back for another oil change in 5000 miles when 15k is recommended by the manufacturer of my car. The Jiffy Lube recommended 5k is, of course, so they'll make more money. That's common among oil change places (not just Jiffy Lube), but annoying and I view it as lying. At the least, it doesn't build trust in them as someone I should let help maintain my car.

Additionally, the right front fender had oily marks from their fender pad in the shape of a long rectangle with 5 quarter-sized circular oil marks in the middle of it. I tried to wipe them off with the inside of my shirt, but the oil just smeared (because, you know, it's oil). I didn't ask them to clean the oil off the car, but come on dudes!?

The guy comes in the waiting area and asked me to come into the oil changing area because he needs my information due to this being my first time there, I give him the information he needs then he asks me to choose the oil type I want but he tells me my car takes synthetic oil at the price of $89.99. I told him I've had my car 3 years and not even the dealership where I bought it put synthetic oil in it so please just put regular oil in.

Knudsen's is probably not the cheapest place you can get your car worked on. Sure, you can take your car to some fly by night mechanic and maybe save a few bucks.

I brought my Acura RSX Type S in because my car had suddenly started violently vibrating all over. The steering wheel, the seats. The car was noisy inside the car. I suspected a motor mount issue, and my hunch was correct. Knudsen's discovered that my last mount had failed. I needed all motor mounts and 1 tranny mount replaced. I was looking at a $1000 repair with parts and labor. Luckily they accept aftermarket auto warranties... so the 3 year, 36,000 mile warranty I bought with the car covered the majority of the repair.

The service is quick, the work is done correctly the first time, and Lyle and the staff will keep you informed on what they're doing to your car, and why. Most of the time I need parts I buy them from Lyle, as I like to give him the business. The few times it made more sense to provide my own parts Lyle was more than willing to do the install for me, and wasn't offended. He's played both sides of the fence, and understands the customers perspective. They're all car guys to the bone. One thing that really stands out for is the several times I've heard Lyle tell customers that they didn't need something, or directs them to a cheaper option. I think it says a lot about the integrity of the shop that Lyle doesn't feel the need to up sell. He makes enough money through honest hard work and repeat business that he doesn't need to gouge you.

For $21 more, they removed my tire from my pretzel wheel and installed and rebalanced it on their good used perfectly round wheel (see pi above), and then they inflated it with nitro-air bcuz I have all green stems. $51 plus a $59 alignment took care of my $590 problem.

Several hours later, after I\\'ve grown tired of the strip we decide to head out and find something more affordable and low key. We end up at a restaurant that\\'s open 24 hours, excellent! It\\'s about 11 p.m. now. As I make a uturn to go into the parking lot something sounds funny, the car won\\'t turn like it should...this just isn\\'t right. We pull into the lot, I get out and low and behold...my rear tire is flat. This is my first flat ever. I can fix a lot of things, but for some reason I was really caught off guard by this. So we ate, I pulled out my AAA card, contemplated them. Then I used the trusty Yelp app on my phone and found this place. Only a mile away! Sweet! And 5 stars? Even better. Open 24 hours? Sold! We make our way over to this place, pull in and they immediately help us out. They told me I shouldn\\'t have driven on a flat tire and that we\\'ll probably have to get it replaced...ahhhh! At this point I\\'m assuming they\\'re going to try and make a quick buck on me. I\\'m a little stressed out and bummed that some of my fun money is going towards this, but oh well, it needed to be done. They offer me a used tire at $35 or a new one for $100. Used please, just as long as it\\'ll get us back to Long Beach in a couple days. They fix it up, throw on the tire and I go to pay. The gent at the register asks if I got a new tire or a used one, I tell him used and he gives me my total....$35!!! Really? Seriously?

Wherever I have tire problems, this is somehow the easiest place to go to. And it's always the first place I can think of that is open, since crap doesn't happen to your tires unless it's 3:30AM. I wanna say I drove by during a major holiday and still saw them sitting around out front waiting for business. That's awesome to me. Who are these people who's tires blow out on them between 9 to 5 on weekdays? I usually refer to them as the Mexicans, which is actually not racist. I have worked in restaurants most of my life, and of all the cultures that have collectively saved my ass in situations, it would be The Mexicans. The way I use it is as if Mexicans are the Cavalry, the fleet, or whatever reliable, dependable backup slang you want to use. And I'm always sure to tip the guys when they're done fixing/ replacing the tire. They give you a good price, also. Sometimes I even have a choice of getting a used tire as a replacement if I don't want a new one. For example, I had a small spare donut. I bought a damaged rim from them and a used tire, just because I wanted a full sized spare. It wasn't meant for daily driving, but was better than the dinky spare the vehicle came with.

Ask for Jimi Stevens. My customer experience here was the best I have ever had from any dealership or auto service provider. Jimi understands the needs of an RV'er (e.g., Do you have prime NY strip steaks in your freezer as I did? He knows to connect your shore power and keep it connected the entire time that the camper is in the shop so that you don't have to worry about transferring most things out of your refrigerator and freezer). The shop technicians immediately assessed the damage to my van and ordered the repair parts which needed to be sent from Germany (and which arrived within 3 days), and the shop completed their repairs within only 4 days after they obtained a MUCH delayed OK from my current (but not future) insurance company, Progressive. Progressive (AVOID THEM RV'ers) could not dispatch an appraiser until almost 2 weeks after the incident occurred and provided me with only a $700 allowance total to pay for towing, accommodations and car rental during the almost 3 weeks I was stranded. The dealership, in contrast, very graciously helped me by providing a loaner vehicle (with unlimited mileage allowance) for the entire period so that I did not need a car rental. And - to top everything off - because the shop had to delay completion of the repairs for 1 day beyond the date they had originally told me the camper would be ready, they absorbed the cost of my insurance deductible. The Henderson Mercedes-Benz Dealership has a certified Sprinter service shop, and if you have invested in a Sprinter camper van, it is the only type of service to consider. I recommend this dealer highly for Sprinter service/repair work, even if your van has to be towed 100 miles to get there as mine did!

Not sure where to start, but this place is totally unprofessional!! I just had the worst experience ever with Red Rock, specifically Wade and Mike. I live out of state but was strongly considering buying a car from Red Rock Auto after seeing one online I liked. I\\'m a serious cash buyer and wanted to proceed further. So, after a week of on going, online negotiations with Wade, I decided to take it to the final step. I told him as a smart consumer I would of course never be able to buy a used car or talk final price without first having it taken to an outside shop for inspection, even from a five- star dealer like he claims to be! But, that pending that outcome, I was more than prepared to make a fair offer on the car. Wade agreed to take it to a shop my mechanic suggested in the area, but, he also said that unless I gave him an \"up front, out the door price\" that it would be a waste of his time to take it for inspection since it would most likely result in a lower offer and essentially, net him less money!!! But a Carfax and dealer claims like Wade\\'s, that a car is in great shape, would certainly be a slim reed to hang a major purchase like a used car on, especially when I might be spending close to $20,000! Don\\'t know about you, but I certainly want that outside inspection done first, so I know exactly what I might, or might not be buying! To make matters worse, the last email I received was from Mike, possibly the owner, who said, \"We have no problem accommodating a buyer by taking the vehicle there, however we have had experiences where buyers have had their vehicles to third party shops, who have been given a clean bill of health and \"thumbs up\" from their selected service shop and then offer a price that isn\\'t feasible for making a purchase. \" They were both obviously afraid I\\'d make a low offer based on whatever the outside shop inspection found. Which must mean they know something would show up on that inspection that would cause me to have concern enough to warrant a lower offer. But, isn\\'t that the whole point of an outside inspection? To protect the consumer from either over paying for a car that isn\\'t worth the amount being asked, and or possibly even buying an unsafe car to begin with??

I took it in for the 7,500 mile service, and had to wait nearly three hours. I'm pretty sure this was a basic inspection and an oil change. Quite a wait when you have an appointment. No efforts were made to let us know what was taking so long, I had to hunt down the service manager to ask. When making the appointment, I was told this would take less than an hour. Recently, at just over 10,000 miles the check engine light came on. I took my vehicle in, and finally after two hours was told it was fine, but the ECM needed updated to change some thresholds. That was Monday. Today, the light has came back on again. Obviously they didn't fix it. The service department here is totally incompetent and could care less about you or your vehicle.

They suggested to take it back to where we purchased it and show it to them. We took it there went up to the counter and they said pull the car around as the flat tire was in the rear of the car.

Mark told the tire tech to remove the tire from the rim. Some girl walked up into the working bay we were in and Mark and her went into his office. The tire tech then called us into the repair bay and asked us if I drive the car with low inflated tires. Who does that! Then Mark came out and said that we were not allowed in the repair bays, I told him we only went in there at the request of the tire tech. So, I waited an hour for someone to tell us what the status was on the tire. I saw the tire in the bay being untouched while 2 trucks came in for air in their tires. I then told the counter guy that i would be back and left him my number to call me with the status. Four hours later I returned, the tire untouched. i spoke with what appeared to be the bug boss who was professional and courteous and explained to me, that i would have to wait on Mark and the other to address the status. After 10 minutes Mark and the other guy showed up and Mark said they would not replace the tire as we had punctured the tire. i argued with him that there was no puncture and if that was the case, then why did we have to wait 5 hours to get that information, when that could have been determined when he first saw it. he then persistently told me to come in the repair and see the puncture. In the bay area we argued about the unfair determination of his assessment of the damage to the tire...continually stating that it was punctured. i reiterated why didn't he tell us that when he first saw it and he did not answer. I told him to put the tire back on the rim in the same manner we brought it in, but he told the tire tech to not put it together. He refused to do it and I told him that he was going to put it in. I then told him if he wasn't so busy with that girl in the office taking care of personal business while a customer waited 5 hours for a simple decision on a defected tire, this could have been resolve. He the started to physically attack me and his boss had to hold him back. I apologized to him after some comments I made. The girl according to him happened to be his sister.

I get a call 30 mins later saying I need a new serpentine belt and four new tires. Mine are only 40k miles run on, but apparently my side walls and the rubber is cracked and dry rot which increases the risk of a blowout. Ok, new tires it is. They want $1000 for four tires for a Ford Escape? Huh? Then he tells me they sell one brand that is \"only\" $650 for the set. So I tell them to do the oil, belt, and tires at a cost of $810. This is 10am. He says my car will be done at 11:30. I tell them I have a lunch meeting at 11:30 and will pick it up between 12:30 and 1pm. Got here at 12:59. My car is not ready. Something about the wrong serpentine belt being sent over and it will be done within 30 minutes. Now it\\'s 40 minutes since I arrived and haven\\'t heard anything.

We went back in with the gm where she says \"yeah they shouldn\\'t have trimmed the heat shield on the vehicle without your consent\" and \"contact repwest, our insurance, to file a claim and they\\'ll take care of it.\" I get a couple weeks later that the claim was denied because of the statements acquired from the GM at that location, Sabrina. I called to speak with her and she didn\\'t know what my next step should be. Repwest told me to call her and she told me to call Repwest. What a runaround. I asked if there was a number to corporate to talk to. She didn\\'t know. I asked if I need to speak with someone higher up, she didn\\'t know. She said she\\'s never dealt with a denied claim before and didn\\'t know what to do. I told her well today will be the day that she\\'ll have to learn but she just said she had no recommendations. What kind of crappy general manager is that? There\\'s always a customer service process and hierarchy. \"I don\\'t know\" just doesn\\'t cut it. Word of advice... Never ever have a hitch installed at uhaul. When they mess up they will do everything they can to avoid fixing it.

I am never coming back nor recommending it to anyone. Uhaul is such a big name brand too, what a horrible experience. Where to start... The parking lot is a disorganized cluster of vehicles, there aren\\'t any signs that tell you where to go upon arrival. I figured it out as I kept driving and assuming I was going the right way. The first guy I met didn\\'t greet or say anything to me. I stood by the Uhaul for a while before he approached me, still not saying a word but holding out his hand. While I reach in my bag for the paperwork, he takes the key out of my hand and opens the Uhaul door. He says hello after I say hello with his head away from me in the vehicle. While huffing and puffing, he asks if I had any problems with the truck and I reply that it was all good except we couldn\\'t get the light to stay on inside the truck. At that moment you would think I was his child because he began scolding me and telling me I didn\\'t do it right. I don\\'t know a lot about operating a Uhaul light so I just said, \"Ohhh ok. Thank you\"...and he continued to degrade and scold me while huffing and puffing and shaking his head. He then asks me if I even refilled the Uhaul because it was short on gas. I showed him my 7/11 fuel receipt and explained that I filled it according to the level shown on the keychain. I still had 20 min left with the truck so not a big deal, I\\'d go back and fill it. I asked him how much it would be to fill it up there. He asks me again, \"Did you even fill it up? Where did you drive to?!\" At this point I got aggravated and answered his question with a little bit of an attitude but mid sentence, with no eye contact-head still in the van he yells at me to just go inside. As I\\'m walking in, he yells that I\\'m going the wrong way. I just kept walking. I had to get as far away from him and as quickly as possible. I was going to blow up. I had no idea where \"inside\" was and I sure as hell didn\\'t deserve the hostility. I was relieved that the young lady inside was pleasant. She explained more on how to fill up and that I wasn\\'t too far off to where the gauge needed to be. She told me not to worry about the remaining gas and sent me on my way. It took me a little bit to get over my frustration with the guy. I just felt it was unnecessary and moving is already frustrating enough.

So you don\\'t necessarily see the counter/employees when you walk in the door, you have to walk past the boxes/supplies. Processing my paperwork/payment was fairly quick and easy. When I went outside to get my truck, the gas tank was EMPTY. I wasn\\'t pissed but I was very annoyed that it didn\\'t match the paperwork and they left it empty. So I had to wait 10 min or so for them to go fill it up. When the guy gets back and I look at it, it\\'s only 1/4 full. I was like what the freakin hell??? I go back inside to let her know so she can match up the paperwork again and I question this and ask why it\\'s not filled up? She said 1/4 of a tank is the minimum they have to fill it. I said what If I have to do some real moving and stuff around town??? Am I supposed to keep filling it to only a 1/4 of a tank since I know you don\\'t reimburse/give credit back to the customer if it\\'s OVER the amount given to us??

I know I have returned trucks here. I had to go to these guys twice, once to rent a 14\\' and then a few days later we went back to them for a 10\\' truck to move my g/f\\'s things out. (My stuff was going to California. I know.) I got most of my things in boxes and had to simply get them out of our home so we could have room to pack the rest of the things. We lived in a 1 bedroom apartment, which to me was INCREDIBLE in retrospect, near Sahara and Palace Station. So many things I could do 24/7 within walking. Oh, how I took that Utopia for granted a mere 2 weeks later. Reservations online were simple: pick a size, pick a location to pick up and pick destination, within or outside of town. Most of the $20/ day trucks and minivans are only within town moves. Put in a credit card and info and you pay when you pick up. Most of the rentals (out of town) are calculated for 4 days. In fact, the only way I think you can do daily is within town. Bam, the amount quoted (brought the printout just in case) was put on the card and away we go. So I go to pick up the truck with some harsh reminders on Sahara. A lot of the auto dealerships are now empty lots with realtor signage and weeds growing from cracks in the cement. Empty stores remain vacant. A Chili\\'s (where my g/f once saw Flava Flav) building days ago had been leveled and was a lot full of rubble and rebar. A Red Robin is now a Habib\\'s. Funny how the national places close, only to be replaced by smaller ethnic businesses, which in turn become larger if they can survive til the market goes back up. I have to support the smaller, local businesses. Still better than strip malls I\\'ve seen vacant in Vegas for longer than the past 4 years when Vegas was still \"booming.\" I pull into the lot and there are a group of guys standing around whistling, trying to get my attention. Day laborers. U-Hauls bring out my best *sarcasm* since I want to pick up the truck when they open to get my full days worth, at 7:00AM. So I\\'m waiting for a bit for them to set up inside. There\\'s already A U-Haul guy from the garage part walking around the front lot. What I notice on the front door is they have a chart with some guys names and rates, mostly around $15/ hour. These are the guys standing there across the street in the abandoned auto dealership. I think it\\'s cool that they at least register, so they appear to be legally paid, it covers them and U-Haul and us, I suppose. The next time I went, I saw an employee walk out across the street to distribute what looked to be paychecks or stubs or something. Do my paper work inside, the people are friendly enough for that time of the morning, I was holding back sore muscle insomnia crankiness myself. I never understand boxes that U-Haul and Public storage (there\\'s another review I have to do) sell. I went around, originally looking at Auto Zone, where I scored Oil boxes before. But I made a major haul at the huge aqua colored recycling bin at Lee\\'s Discount liquor (another review!). And if you use the plastic crates on the side as steps to get boxes, at least be respectful and put them back. So the truck is parked out front, running* where they let you do a pre inspection. It\\'s important to point out every dent and let them put an \"x\" sticker on it, or they\\'ll blame you for damage when you return the truck. Check under the front where people run over things and the tire wells and the top corners for those attempting drive thru. She was cool about putting stickers on every little thing. And then you\\'re off, they get you out of there pretty quick. *So I get home and take the key out of the ignition. Was I groggy or was there not a buzzing? I spent the day trying to load, but it was over 110 degree heat. So I slept the rest of the day and then waited for my g/f to get home so she could sit in the back of the truck and watch it while I loaded it. I couldn\\'t move the truck. The battery was dead because the LIGHTS HAD BEEN ON ALL DAY. The attendant put the lights on and didn\\'t tell me. And I didn\\'t know or think to turn them off.

I bought a pre-owned 2008 Aspen SUV from Wheels In Motion & please read the entire review. At first I was impressed with the condition of the car, it was 95% of I would say, \" Show Room \" condition in appearance. The SUV really looked good & was well taken cared of. It did have some miles on it but again it was in great shape. I bought the car after a test drive for 15 minutes & on the next day there was a problem, as can be expected with a pre-owned car but not so fast, lol. But here in lies the reason to buy a car & work w/this with this dealership. The car virtually shut down on the first day of owning it & needless to say I was really annoyed. I called the salesperson who helped me, Perry, & left a VM in the evening @about 9:30pm. The call was returned w/in 10 minutes & so began what i feel was an impressive response by this dealership. The next day the owner, Tim, contacted me & told me he would come by my home to pick up the car personally & address any issue it had. Tim was on time & very polite as well as understanding. He took the car to a local Firestone repair center & they worked on it for two days to track down the problem which turned out to be a loose connection w/in the cars computer ( which could have happened @any time.) Now I had also purchased a warranty for the car which would have covered this but Wheels In Motion paid for the repair needed out-of -pocket. This SUV ( which is a second car ) now runs fine & has no other problems so far. I will post a second review in 1/2 months on the SUV again. My point though is this. Most pre-owned cars are going to have issues, we all know that. But this dealership & it\\'s owner ( and Perry ) were VERY pro-active in helping me & rectifying the issue. We all want to buy a car from someone who is honest & stands behind what they sell...Wheels In Motion certainly did this & I would suggest that if you are in the market for a pre-owned car give them a call & see if they can provide you with what you are looking for. I have been in sales for 30 years & one thing I can really appreciate is a business that stands behind what they sell.

I never experienced this place with the previous owners so I can only base my reviews on how they are now. ABC is your standard Chinese bakery with a lot of hot food you can order as well. I have always seen this place whenever I come to same plaza for dim sum. It looks very small on the outside but there's a large amount of tables and space when you come inside. ABC has all the items you would expect from a Chinese bakery and then some. For breakfast, they have a couple of combos that of great value ion my opinion. I got a combo which included a beef brisket noodle, egg sandwich and a very large cold milk tea for $6.50. The beef brisket noodle had a great amount of brisket and a good amount of veggies to boot. Normally you get no veggies at all! I love the owners. It seems to be a ma and pa type of ownership. They were very nice and friendly. Their English could use some work but they try very hard to get an understanding with you if you don't speak Chinese. It seems though, that it's only them working the front with some kitchen staff in the back. When it get super busy, you can expect some wait times. I'm really glad I decided to try this place out. I can so see myself coming here instead if I don't want to wait for dim sum. I love supporting a local business and this is straight up one of the businesses we should be supporting.\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — ABC Bakery Coffee Shop', \"Best egg-tarts in town! There's really not much to say about a hong kong style fastfood restaurant. You don't come here for the customer service, you don't come here for the luxurious architecture, and you don't come here on a first date. What you do come here for is cheap and authentic hong kong dishes, the bakery, and the FRESH EGG TARTS.\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — ABC Bakery Coffee Shop', \"I've been to ABC Bakery a few times since I read they were one of the top places for egg tarts. Nothing beat the first time I went though, I'd have given it 5 stars for those egg tarts. Unfortunately, the experience has been worse and worse with each time I've went. The fact that it's under new ownership explains a lot. On my most recent visit, I ordered a bowl of wonton noodles, a slice of Chinese White Honeycomb Cake (???), and an egg tart for $10 flat. The wonton noodles are okay, you get six (smaller-than-average) wontons in the bowl and a lot of noodles with some chopped scallions. The white honeycomb cake is decent and you get a fairly large slice. The supposed star of the show, the egg tart, was extremely disappointing. The egg tart looked like the biscuit ones, instead of with the flaky crust (????). When we asked, the lady (who doesn't speak any English) said it is a new low-fat recipe. The more health-conscious decision is not worth it because there wasn't much rise in the pastry itself and it became more dense to eat. The egg custard was also bland and lacked flavour and sweetness. I've never really had bad egg tarts before but this was by far the worst in my experience. The mini dim sum egg tarts are better, even ones from Chinese buffets I'd say are better. While everything was cheap, I was left with an unsatisfying experience from a longtime favourite. I might give it one more try, though not for many months. I'd have given it a 1-star rating, but I'll give it an extra star based on its history and for the previous owners.\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — ABC Bakery Coffee Shop', \"FYI, Closed Monday's New ownership for about 10 weeks, new menu's, the classic egg tart is not the same as it was before, it was hot but not cook long enough in the oven or something as the egg tart is stuck to the aluminum holder and as you try to pry the egg tart off, it literally fell apart, NOT GOOD. Nice try by the new owners but not enough for me to come back. Unfortunately the previous owners has retired. It was a great institution for so long as I will find another place before they become all extinct.\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — ABC Bakery Coffee Shop', 'The inside may not look like much but they make a mean egg tart and have very good BBQ pork buns.

I usually order the Beef Brisket on Rice, as I admire the cheap meat's tenderness to price ratio, which is seemingly earned from hours of cooking.

Good enough for a quick lunch.\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — ABC Bakery Coffee Shop', 'This place got to have the best Hong Kong style egg tarts in town.

So thankful for the one who invented this tart for a afternoon snack favourite for many people from Hong Kong. The milk tea is also really creamy with rich black tea taste. I always come here just for the egg tarts. I had to wait 20 minutes for the freshly baked egg tarts. For $0.95 a tart is a wonderful price with a large milk tea for $1.60 is really nice to my wallet. lol! The decor is a little dated, but I like the newly renovated washroom.

I read the Yelp reviews and thought I'd give it a try. We usually go somewhere else to buy egg tarts but their pastry cases have been getting hard, so we need a new place to get them from now. He brought back 6 and they were still hot when he got them home, wish he'd not let them sweat in the plastic bag. They were a tad sweet for my liking but they were delicious. The cases were flaky but not too crumbly, like most places, that just disintegrate, when you bite or touch them. Only negative was the really orange colour of the shell and filling. My 11 year old gave them a big thumbs up, but she likes any dessert. My 9 year old daughter, who doesn't normally eat egg tarts, period, ate one and said it was ok.

I love that old school vibe at ABC Bakery. This cafe has been around for over 20 years and I did have high expectations for their egg tart. Egg Tart & Milk Tea ($2.45) Just maybe because of my personal preference, I love the egg custard which has this sweet and aromatic smell of eggs and the texture is smooth. But the crust itself was heavy and doughy even when the tart was still warm to touch. The Milk Tea was meh. Not hot enough, not smooth enough and just not up to par. While I was there, most people were here buying egg tarts and egg tarts only as there was only some stale uninteresting offerings on the display. I doubt I will be back.

The tart is really tasty, and seemed freshly baked when we got them. They are massive as well... and really cheap (85c). Amazing value given how good these things taste. My only complaint is that the pastry itself is a little too crumbly, and also I'd prefer the top to be more burnt (Macau style). But these are very minor complaints. Cash only. Ample parking.

I have been searching for great Egg Tarts and I was always a fan of Les Chateaux's Egg Tarts because they make very consistent good egg tarts, but I am happy and surprised I found somewhere that makes even better ones! ABC Bakery Coffee Shop probably bakes the BEST Egg Tarts in Markham area. They are always in high demand and last time I came, I had to wait 15 minutes for their new batch as the old were sold out.

After a 40 minute trip to my friend's home, I couldn't believe they were still warm! The middle is very silky; and in contrary to some other reviewers, my crust was nice and flaky.

Milk Tea was quite nice and enjoyable. Best part was getting the $2.90 in coins back in my pocket. The environment atmosphere was a bit awkward. The customers were either single individuals or even when in multiples they were freaky quiet compare to any HK Bakery Cafes.

I had three as soon as I bought them - and regardless of whether or not that was a good idea, I don't regret it a bit! The strange thing is that while others have told me that the crust is supposed to be the flakey version, mine was less flakey and more solid. Doesn't detract from me inhaling them all though. This bakery has been around for a long time and I can't believe I've only gone there now. It also serves other Chinese cafe style foods as well as other Chinese pastries with seating.

I would call them pasties because I'm from Michigan but someone else might think of them as empanadas because we're closer to Mexico. Either way they are delicious and reasonably priced. Their soups are homemade, hearty, and scrumptious in any kind of weather.

Highly Recommended! Friends wanted to meet for brunch, so I browsed my Yelp bookmarks and came up with AZ Food Crafters. Everyone agreed, so we gave it a try - and we were very glad we did! Food: I love the variety on the menu - so many things to try! And since Hatch chiles are in season, AZ Food Crafters has a special selection, which I was eager to try. I ended up with the Two Savory Pies combo so I could sample two different hand pies. I had the Green Chile Pork Empanada (a favorite of Yelpers) and the Green Chile Relleno, one of their spicier choices. I have one word to describe this: WOW!! The empanada crust was nice and flaky, not dense and chewy. And the flavors were amazing! My order came with ranch dressing and a wonderful hatch chile sauce, which was great for dipping. I must say, while the Green Chile Pork was flavorful, it was also fairly dry. I expected it to be a bit more moist. But the Green Chile Relleno, made with Hatch chiles, was simply excellent! It was moist, and fairly spicy - although not over-the-top-burn-your-lips-off spicy. This one\\'s a definite repeater. With my Yelp check-in, I also got a free dessert empanada - so cool. I decided on another Hatch chile selection: the Green Chile & Apple Pie with a Cheddar Crust. Holy smokes, was this good!!! If you come here while this is still available, by all means get it!! It was sweet and spicy, and a bit cheesy too. Amazing flavors! I can\\'t recall what everyone else had, but they were all happy with their selections. Cost: My Two Savory Pie Combo was a very reasonable $7.50 before tax. The amazing dessert pie was free, otherwise would have been $4. So ya, AZ Food Crafters has great value. Service: The staff were very friendly, patiently answering all our first-timer questions. It took a while for our food to come out, but not too long, and we all got fresh, hot empanadas. Atmosphere: The seating area is very small, probably seats around a dozen people. And the \"kitchen\" area is just across the counter, which is neat because you can watch the staff do their work. All-in-all the atmosphere is ok, but nothing special. Overall: I was really impressed with the food and staff, and can\\'t wait to return to try some of the other selections.

Then I HAD to take a jar home too. :-) We do not eat out much, but we used to go to a pasty place down the street a few times a year. No more... this place really hit the spot. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and quality ingredients. For the three of us the lunch was probably around $35-$40. Not sure since we took some dessert pies home. A dozen for $14. Perfect. They were really small, but that\\'s one of the reasons I like this place more than the other pasty (think empanada or pie) place. Smaller is better because you can try different flavors. The hand pie is somewhat small, but with a side and fruit, the meal really fills you up.

The immediate reaction by the staff was an excuse or defensive approach \"oh, we cook with paprika that\\'s probably it\"...instead of examining the meat and seeing it truly was half-cooked. Then once she realized it was in need of further cooking she sent back to the kitchen. After a few minutes passed, I was greeted with the same exact meal I was served - yes, that\\'s right - the turkey patty I cut in half with the same sweet potato slices and all topped together as if to pass it on as brand new. I understand not being wasteful, but never in any other dining experiences have I been served the original dish if anything was in question.

I asked them where the sign is and she showed me....the problem with their signage was that it did not say in bold letter CASH ONLY, instead, it was a paragraph explains their debit/visa machine was broken and so they will only be accepting cash payment. The sign was not highlighted or the word cash was not even underlined. I had walked right past the sign without thinking anything of it, that was how not visible their sign were. If both their debit AND visa machines aren't working, I believe their staff have the obligation to inform customers when they do their ordering, so that they don't waste their time like I did. They suggested I go to the bank next door, which I tried, but as I didn't bank with that particular bank, I was asked to pay a $3 convenience charge, which I was not about to pay as it was the restaurants problem, not mine. I ended up walking away without my meal feeling very annoyed having my time wasted. It did not help that the staff were unapologetic and blamed me for missing their puny sign.

We both went for the omelets, you can't go wrong with eggs and toast now can you? And I was right! The omelets are cooked within view of the customers and you get to see the Omelet Maker flip your order with precision. My order of ham and cheese omelet with mushrooms and toast with a side of roasted potatoes (at additional charge) filed up the plate on which they were placed and turned out tasty. Alot of the ready-made food like salads and sandwiches are also invitingly display in their respective stations. The delicious looking cakes are also well-displayed but there is not an overwhelming selection of them so that makes it easy to take your picks from the sweet choices. There's even a cute-looking bunch of gingerbread cookies among the display for this festive season. And there's an eye-catching nifty row of mugs with the Bakery Garden logo displayed on the shelves behind the counter of pastries. The moderately sized cafe is spacious enough for customers to move around while looking at the food and reading the menus. There is also enough seating inside so that the place doesn't get too filled-up with patrons. My cousin and I were there around 12pm and the cafe was getting busy enough but there was still room to move around without bumping into anyone, and we were able to get a table for the two of us.

It looked really unappetizing. The biggest concern I had was when the Cook handled raw meat before touching our bread, etc. ~ we requested refund afterwards for our food. Wanted to order their juices, but could tell they were not up to code standards when they kept it in a bucket instead of using the fridge - stacking cups on top of one another! The funny thing is, they put fruits and veggies in the fridge where the drinks use to be. Really odd that they are using the fridge like a display cabinet.

Total memory lane here... they used to have a huge oven and made the world's best bruschetta with melted cheese on it. *drooool* My first impression of this place was ... C H A O S. You're not really sure where to line up or where the line starts. The ratio of customer to employee was like 50:1. Chaos makes me very tired. There are quite a few tables with only one gentleman in charge of the cleaning of it. Obviously he can't clean all of them within minutes so when walking around and looking for a place to sit, many of the tables looked disgustingly dirty. The food was 'meh.' I ordered the vegetable barley soup, which is apparently low in fat and low in calories. It was bland, but this might be due to the fact that its lacking in yummy fat. Who knows.

I returned and managed to get the attention of one of the staff and placed an order for a soup & sandwich. I was soon handed a bowl of soup, but no tray. I looked around in the vacinity for a tray, and had to ask where they were. They were back by the cashier. Odd, but ok. I put the soup down, retrieved a tray, came back, and waited for the sandwich. When it was all ready to go, I went back to the cashier and paid after she had messed up my drink order several times, which did nothing to improve her mood. I looked around and found a table, only to realize I hadn't been given any utensils. I looked around the tray area for spoons, but couldn't find one. I went back to the now clearly aggrivated cashier and asked her for one, and she directed me to a spot obscured in a corner behind the cashier and drink cooler. All in all, there was no signage, and the layout of the ordering/trays/cashier/utensil station was only apparent if you're used to coming here or a member of the staff. The portion size was quite large, but I didn't want to pester the already annoyed staff with a request for to go packaging. The staff was rude and inattentive.

We had a donut, a bagel sandwich, and a breakfast burrito. The sandwich and burrito were HUGE! The bagel was practically the same size as my husband's huge man hands. We got one that came with eggs, cheese, sausage and bacon. Very filling! The eggs seemed like maybe poured/liquid eggs but they were cooked well and didn't have that fake taste like poured eggs usually do. The burrito was really tasty, and I loved that it was not at all greasy. If I had to pick something to critique, I wish the potatoes had been crispy (they're more like just blanched), but they were still tasty. Service was super friendly and fast. I think they heard me mention it was warm in the seating area - I wasn't complaining, more of just an observation- but minutes later the AC came on :-) that was nice.

I haven't been to Mauritius yet (my fiancee is from there), but if the Blue Bay Cafe is even a half decent representation of the food there, I will love it! I thought it would be a fun surprise to take my fiancee here on her birthday, and she wasn't expecting it at all! It's pretty awesome that we have a Mauritian restaurant in Canada, given that Mauritius' population is barely over 1 million, and even better that it is really good. I've given away my bottom line, sure, but I wasn't expecting this place to be this good. It's very Toronto (I'm from the burbs), so small, quaint and very non-corporate (all good things I suppose) as well non-trendy. It's like, real, man. We ordered the crevette au couer de palmiste (shrimp served with tangy palm hearts) for her, and I ordered the carri ourite (octupus curry). Both of these came with rice and two kinds of chutneys. The shrimp dish wasn't bad at all. The shrimp, not bad in portion was well-cooked and flavourful, but the palm hearts lacked discernible taste and the sauce they were in was bland as well. My fiancee really regretted not ordering the octopus (we usually order different dishes to be able to sample more) since she loves her mom's octopus curry, but more so because it was absolutely fantastic! This dish was the showstopper, the dish you go to this restaurant for. Octopus is a difficult protein to cook right. Unlike other kinds of seafood, you don't just cook it fast & high and simply make sure you don't overcook it. Octopus needs to stew... for a while. It goes from just tender (when its not really cooked) to hard to tender again at some point in the cooking process, and you will find that most places do not do it right. The Blue Bay cafe does. The curry itself was just delicious, and even now, after much time has passed, the flavour lingers on in my mind, beckoning. You don't need to worry about what Mauritian food is or isn't, or whether you'll like it. Like a restaurant of the highest grade, the people at the back of the Blue Bay cafe really care about their food, and it shows. This is what all restaurants should be like... good food, served without fuss.\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — Blue Bay Cafe', 'Another one of my favourite places in the city, been coming here for over 20 years!

I had a rosewater and saffron cake that was perfectly balanced in terms of flavor, with nothing too overwhelming or at risk of smothering the other flavors, and that is a difficult combination to pull off. E: Having sandwiches available for purchase. Much as I love baked goods and coffee, eventually the human body needs something more substantial to function.

Quick, efficient, despite being busy, friendly, wait-until-I-finish-my-sentence-sensitive, good recommendations on food. Corrected themselves when they were wrong in what they told me previously and so on. The two dishes I've had are: Special Salmon and jumbo lump crab meat. It was expertly cooked, great flavors, good portion size, and overall just a winning dish. Di Mare Amante which is a dish with shrimp, scallops, in a white clam sauce with capellini noodles. Their menu spells it with two p's: cappellini. Both were great and I'd have them again. You know, part of my review and rating is based on exactly what this place is: a more upscale place for the mostly business clientele bringing their customers out for a conveniently located lunch. In a restaurant that is more or less in a food court. Being surrounded chinese joints, mexican burrito places, and the philly cheese steak place. While I think it would be a solid bet for dinner as well --- that's not how I see this place positioned. I wouldn't take a date here Friday or Saturday night.

I go out to eat quite a bit, and I try to eat at as many new places as possible because I get bored easily. This year, with my birthday around the corner, I've been in a bit of a food slump because I feel like I've had many of things Toronto has to offer already. Chawk ended that slump. I can't stop gushing. First, the inside is beautiful. Very chic, very modern, and very Instagrammable. Second, the service is super friendly and super helpful. Even before we ordered, complimentary lychee mango drinks were given to us. What an indication of the meal to come! The food. THE FOOD. I can't say enough good things about the food. If I don't hit the character limit for this review, I'll be super surprised. Chawk has two appetizer platters. Both of them are stunning and come on a wooden board. Both of them consist of entirely different options. Each come with 4 appetizers, and cost $15. The chawk platter came with phuchka (pani puri with mashed chickpea inside), mini singara (almost like a samosa), bihari sliders (beef kebab on fresh flatbread), and macher tikki (fishcake). Oh. And chop suey fries? Think really thin, delicious, fried potato string garnish. Phuchka - You fill the phuchka with tamarind water and you down it fast. Otherwise, it leaks out. It's meant to be that way. Savory, refreshing, slightly sweet, slightly tangy. Mini Singara - Almost like a rounded samosa. The potato and chickpea filling was very fluffy. I appreciated being able to see the layers of filling in my singara. The tamarind sauce was tasty as well. Macher tikki - I was skeptical. Fish cakes aren't my thing. Usually over-breaded and over-spiced. Not the case here. Thin breading. Could still taste the fish under it. Crispy. Flaky. Served with a spiced mayo. Bihari slider - three/four bite taco sized. AMAZING. You could taste the beef through the spices. The carrot/beet/onion strings on top helped cut some of the richness, and the flatbread was so fluffy! I could make a meal out of these babies and be super satisfied. Then comes our main. Just one between the two of us because the appetizer platter was so large. All day breakfast. Interesting. Lamb shank, frittata, steamed spicy potatoes, tart eggplants, stuffed parathas, fruit chaat, and an egg done our way. Also $15, and also served on a board. Well, a board and a plate, cuz the lamb shank wouldn't fit onto the board. Our sunny side up was done right. Oozy yolk. Plus points for crispy brown edges. I've got to hand it to them. Every curried food item we had tasted distinct. No base sauces here. They're all different. The potatoes weren't masked by the curry. I'm a sucker for Indian eggplant dishes and this one didn't disappoint. The fruit chaat was like a yogurt filled with berry bits and spices. And I mean filled. Loads of fruit in here. I rather enjoyed it. Didn't know frittatas were Indian. This one was tasty though. Also quite fluffy. Big chunk of broccoli on top. The least Indian tasting food we had, but tasty nonetheless. The lamb shank. IT WAS HUGE. Biggest lamb shank I've ever seen. Also tender and smelled incredible. Great indications for taste. I can't say enough good things about it. A bit of the egg, a piece of the lamb, and a bit of the eggplant on a piece of their paratha and you've got one heck of a bite! The leftovers are going to be amazing. And there were leftovers. But then we had dessert. This birthday girl thought ahead. Asked about birthday specials. Secret menu? The key to my heart. Deep fried kulfi. Um... Woah much. We had the fried kulfi (malai/milk flavored) and the paan kulfi (because what is paan?). The paan kulfi was interesting. Was told paan is a leaf that is usually filled with spices and then chewed after a meal. Good to know, but no clue what it should taste like. In my mind, that means I have to try it. It looks like pistachio. It tastes floral and minty and is subtly spiced, but I couldn't tell you with what. It was definitely interesting. The fried kulfi was all about textural contrast. Creamy kulfi with a crunchy fried exterior. Not too sweet. Not too breaded. Very enjoyable. Dessert was free (presumably because birthday) and they still made it beautiful. Long rectangular dish, berry garnishes, gooseberry garnish, cinnamon bark strips, little sprinkles of spices. The aesthetics are just WOW. $30 plus tax and tips for so much amazing food. Bang for buck plus service and ambiance makes this easily one of my new favorite restaurants in Toronto, and I've only had two dishes on the menu. I can't wait to come again and try the rest.

The greens had no meat or fat, in fact they have a little sign saying that they do not use pork fat/lard in their cooking, so I guess these greens are pretty healthful. They were mild and flavorful, with perfect salt again. The slaw was a fine Carolina chop with a very good creamy dressing that was slightly but not too sweet with good depth. Black-eyed peas were similar to the pintos, plain, no meat, but flavorful and tender. Ms T did not like the fried okra as well as she usually does. I will have to yield to her expertise, put I liked it. She felt it had been parboiled before frying, leaving it a little soggy. It had mild but nice okra flavor coming through the light coating.

Then, although this was probably enough food to provide a full meal for most diners, in order to be able to pen a more robust restaurant review I nevertheless moved on to an Orleans Clubhouse Sandwich. The Orleans Clubhouse Sandwich here needs to be distinguished from its close cousin, the Chicken Clubhouse Sandwich, which is also on the menu. My Orleans Club, packed with both ham and bacon, Smoked Gouda Cheese, lettuce, tomato, and some mayo, on lightly toasted bread, almost did me in. Fresh and tasty as it was, it was comprised of four very large, toothpicked together sandwich sections. At first I removed a toothpick to eat what I thought was a section, only to learn that I had not drilled down low enough, leaving a crucial part behind on the plate. Once properly holding a complete sandwich section in my hand and after aiming it upward to bite down on with my teeth, I was barely able to get my mouth around the whole length. It took awhile, but eventually I finished the entire sandwich, although I hardly needed to. And it was very satisfying, served with good skin-on Fries and fresh strands of cabbage that joined together to fashion a cool Slaw. A bowl of Oxtail Soup overflowing with big clumps of oxtail meat was ordered by my poker-playing friend visiting from Texas, and he pronounced it to be very tasty. It quickly became clear to me that, even more than the Gumbo, the Oxtail Soup here is designed to furnish a complete solo meal. I will keep this in mind when giving it a try myself in the future. The brightened room has a nice new look, and faux leather seating was comfortable. Service was good, except for slow bringing of food to the table after production of the Gumbo. But, in fairness to the cooks and waitstaff, we were dining during the 12 o'clock lunch hour, and just about every seat in the room was occupied.

Carved into the former coat check area of this nightclub long known for its tropical tunes and dancing -- the music doesn't stop during Sunday brunch -- Cortadito Express offers a modest menu of Cuban choices. I ordered the Dirty Bird sandwich over my typical favorite, the Cubano. The pulled chicken was roasted to perfection, with the slaw providing a sweet, crunchy contrast and the spicy mayo completing a trifecta of textures and flavors. The bread was fresh and toasted just right. The meat croquettes are somehow crispy, yet they melt in your mouth with their cheesy potato filling. I had a bite of my wife's Cuban sandwich. The pork was seasoned just right with a perfect amount of yellow mustard on the same well-toasted bread. I'll order it next time but will skip the side baguette, which unlike the sandwich bread was dry and didn't seem fresh.

For just over $11, you get an offering of ceviche, freshly made guacamole, chips and two croquettes of two kinds-potato and meat served with a side of delicious aioli. The ceviche was nicely prepared-you could taste the freshness of the fish balanced by the acidity of the citrus it has been marinated in. The guacamole also was well done although scooping it out in the narrow serving dish was a tad difficult. I think the croquettes, however, stole the show. Biting through the brown crispy shell allows you access to the warm, soft potatoey gooey-ness on the inside. Dipping them into the aioli was a decadent treat. The Dirty Bird sandwich is also noteworthy. Served on a cuban roll baked that morning, it is an exciting blend of shredded and marinated chicken, chipotle, jicama, roasted corn, sweet potato, and cilantro with a harisa aoili dressing. It is something I could eat every week and never get bored of. Since the kitchen is located within the Cardinal, there isn\\'t any dedicated seating per-se. Rather, have a seat wherever you like in (or at) the bar and they will bring the food out to you. Since I was already over-caffeinated up from an earlier stop, I did not try any of their coffee offerings but if they are even half as good as their food, I will be a big fan.

I am VERY selective when it comes to breakfast so if you\\'re deciding between two places hope this helps. We ordered a breakfast burrito and the French toast with mixed berries ~ both were delicious. At $4.99 the breakfast burrito is a steal but more important than the value, was the taste. The eggs were fluffy, potatoes cooked perfectly, bacon crisp (as requested) and cheese perfectly portioned. (One of my biggest pet peeves is the overuse of cheese to mask the shortcomings of other ingredients.) Beyond the quality, I also really appreciated the craftsmanship of the burrito. All the ingredients were assembled to perfection and beautifully balanced (see pic) vs. overwhelmingly big and hard to eat (ie: falling apart). If I lived around here this would be my go-to order. The French toast was also solid. Nicely sized bread/ thickness and favorable texture (no soggy edges here). Most notable however were the mixed berries I requested as the topping. They were impressive - envision a farm fresh, high integrity compote. I honestly wasn\\'t expecting that level of quality from the fruit but it was a welcomed surprise. Beyond the food, the service was great. Friendly and helpful. I really appreciate it when the staff proactively inquires if you\\'d like your plates split. They portioned our French toast for us to avoid the hassle of taking turns on bites (my mom and I were sharing both of the orders). Atmosphere is cute-ISH. Nothing to write home about but absolutely fine for what it is. In truth, if you consider the cost/QUALITY of our meal (roughly $15) the atmosphere is very nice. We didn\\'t sit outside but I like that they have the option. My only \"meh\" comment is regarding the croissant I got to go. It wasn\\'t a top pick. In fairness I waited a few hours post bfst to eat it (that probably contributed). Didn\\'t rank highly so if you\\'re thinking about pastries or a real bfst - I\\'d encourage going the protein route. Get the burrito! All in all, this will be a DEFINITE must hit every time I\\'m in town. Tip* Be sure to check if they have a free coupon via YELP - I scored a free coffee when we went.

Two employees were on shift and no other customers were in the store when I arrived. It took a few minutes for one of the two employees to approach the cash register to take my order-which seemed to be an unnecessary wait. I ordered an iced caramel latte which is a pretty straight forward menu item. After waiting about ten minutes at the counter with an unwrapped straw in hand, the same guy that took my order asked if I was waiting on anything. He had literally taken my order and then forgotten about it moments later. He did apologize when I reiterated my order but acted as if it was the first time he had heard of my wanting a latte. It took the guy three times to make my drink. The first time, he left out the caramel. The second time, he dumped the drink out after it was made. It was on the third attempt that he was able to hand off the beverage to me. Mind you, I know about his failings due to his cursing and dropping the \"F\" bomb with every other action behind the counter. The finished latte was pretty underwhelming. The overly abundant caramel syrup wasn\\'t mixed well and tasted pretty artificial. The drink lacked whipped cream and caramel drizzle on top. I have worked at several Dunkin Donuts as a shift leader throughout high school and into my first year of college. This store is an embarrassment to the brand due to the general lack of service, attention and skill displayed through this interaction. Train your employees to competently make menu items.

Knowing it was going to be a \"hip\" place (all the cool places have one word names right?) and seeing the gigantic rainclouds overhead, we took our chances. I walk in and immediately I\\'m lovin\\' it. Remember that this place used to be a pretty mediocre convenient store, but it has been transformed into a really one-of-a-kind coffee bar. I\\'m saying coffee bar because there\\'s an actual bar surrounding the drink creation area. I was giggling the whole time at the \"fuel\" theme, which reminds me of a gas station 99 cent coffee blend (cough cough Sheetz). I ordered the iced fuel, while my friends got the fuel of the day. My friends enjoyed their hot fuel while I was delightfully surprised at how smooth the iced fuel was. Here\\'s the dealbreaker, folks. When you go into other little independently owned coffee shops, there\\'s usually half-n-half, sugar, Splenda, stirrers, and that\\'s just about it. NOT HERE. CONDIMENTS GALORE. You can add syrups FOR FREE in your beverage, choose from 5 different sweeteners....or even more(?), add half-and-half or whole milk, and powder up your beverage to perfection with chocolate or cinnamon. Having a myriad of add-ins allows for my beverage to be ~perfect~. The seating area is very intimate and cozy. The bar seats up to 3 people and the shop seats about 10, which is really neat when you want to clamp down and read a book, but can be a huge bummer when there is open mic night. That being said, we visited Fuel during a high schooler\\'s \"my first open mic\" experience, where she played covers of awful mid 2000s soft rock songs. New Shoes by Paolo Nutini and You\\'re Beautiful by James Blunt anyone? No thank you. We were stuck in this odd situation similar to a coffee shop purgatory, where some of us sat down 5 feet away from her, and others stood from afar. There came a point where we all realized that we much rather sit outside in the light rain at this point than handle another 20 minutes of acoustic covers.

I was even more impressed by the vegetable wrap, for it was a filling size (had to take the other portion to-go) & it came with these tofu-like fries with seasoning & a dip sauce on the side that was amazing! Walking in, I was a little questionable about this place, even more so by the price, but after tasting it for myself, it's actually quite good here. I debated giving it three stars, but I was reminded by my green smoothie it's definitely a place I'd like to return to when I'm in the neighborhood craving a healthy alternative to other restaurants surrounding them!\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — Greens and Proteins', \"I had the chicken sausage pizza and it was excellent.

The place was empty but it seemed to fill up over the next 15 minutes. The server brought everyone to attention and asked that we do NOT look at the food menu. He insisted that it would be best to NOT look at the menu because \"of the way it works\" it can be very confusing. He recommended that HE order for us based on our dietary restrictions and tastes. (Sidenote: this is a tapas bar. Everyone is aware that the plates are to share. There are 8-10 small dishes and 3-4 larger dishes on the menu. It was not complicated). After this, he came by our table to take our drink order. Shortly after, our drinks arrived but he had gotten the order wrong (we were three people). He came back with the correct drink and asked us what we would like to eat. As per his instruction, we did not look at the menu...long story short, he said that if we let him order for us, he would be conservative in his order and we would not be looking at a huge bill of $300. He recommended a few dishes and from that, we gathered we should just order for ourselves. We ordered 5 tapas dishes,1 main and 1 dessert. Warning: if you are hungry, do not come here. The food is literally ONE bite and each plate is designed for 2 people to share. He adjusted the plates to accommodate 3 people but of course, charged 1.5X the price. This restaurant is extremely overpriced for the portions and design. I\\'ve eaten at some wonderful restaurants that are meant to serve food designed to evoke different tastes and senses ... this is not one of them. The server actually went on to tell us how \"the chicken is not working these days\". Cesar came by towards the end of our meal to welcome us. He asked if we had tried the olives and we said that we hadn\\'t because we had decided against it. He insisted that we try the olives and \"not to worry\". We assumed that meant he was treating us to some olives because it was something he was proud to serve. The olives never made it to our table and our bill came shortly after that interaction... with olives included in the price. Including a 15% tip (honestly, this was generous at this point - the server was EXTREMELY chatty and over-complicated the experience) it came to $97 each. We paid roughly $15 for each bite of food. All was not lost, the new bartender made DELICIOUS cocktails. He was the highlight of the evening.', 'negative'], ['Yalp — Hola Tapas Bar', 'Dinner at Hola this evening was a fiasco that left us laughing about the completely amateurish attempt at haute-cuisine tapas. We could not leave fast enough! I have had better service in the food court of a shopping mall. It left us really wondered if the staff (who were all very friendly) were trying to be bad on purpose. A short list of transgressions include (1) Our drinks came 20 minutes after ordering. The waiter told us the cachaça based drink I had ordered was \"extremely complex\". To add insult to injury the waitress tried to take our drinks away before we had finished....I know the place is dimly lit but come on did you ask if we were done??? How oblivious can you be!!!!! (2) Three staff came to out table in the 40 minutes before one finally asked about our dinner order, (3) The waiter only noticed we had no utensils after our second course was served (we ate the first course with our fingers), (4) we requested water three times before finally being served a glass each with our final courses, and (5) the last two (from a total of five) tapas plates came to us well over 30 minutes after the prior plate. There were fifteen patrons and three staff (including the owner) out front so there are no excuses for such poor service. If you are going to charge high prices and are attempting to pitch yourself as a fine dining restaurant you should at the very least ensure the level of service customers receive is professional. In summary the food was creative but mediocre, prices were shamelessly expensive and service was clumsy and inattentive. Hola is like a parody of what fine dining should be.', 'negative'], ['Yalp — Hola Tapas Bar', 'I really had no idea what to expect when I booked Hola Cafe. I had made same-day plans to meet a friend for dinner and did a quick look online for places in Leslieville with high ratings, and the first restaurant to pop up was Hola Cafe. (Note that the menu has changed recently so this review is based on what I understand is a more upscale menu compared to their earlier menu that included things like empanadas and other \"snacks\"). To start, Cesar, the owner, called me to confirm the reservation that afternoon and checked on any food allergies. I thought it was a nice touch that he was the one to call and also that he introduced himself, so when I walked in, I felt like we were already old friends and Cesar was there to greet me when I arrived. We started with yummy pisco sours, a nice memory for me of time I\\'ve spent in Peru and Ecuador. Both Cesar and our server gave us recommendations for our meal and we shared 5 small dishes plus the steak. Each dish involved elaborate preparation based on science. I found the process very interesting but probably what matters here is to say that every bite was outstanding. The olives, which are not exactly olives but rather made of olives, were such a delightful surprise. The prosciutto-wrapped dates were a wonderful combination of sweet and savory and the artichokes with brie were delicious but my favourite dish overall was the chicken boccadillo, which actually uses perfectly crisp chicken skin as the \"bread\". I was so distracted by how delicious it was, I can\\'t remember everything Cesar told me about it but I\\'m salivating thing about it! My friend also had the crab cakes which she said were fantastic. This might sound like a lot of food but it\\'s not like the tapas you\\'ve had in Basque bars in Barcelona; chunks of bread with little morsels of food on top of them. Each tapas plate came with 2 or 3 bite-sized items, so along with a the steak that we shared (which was also perfectly done), we had just enough to eat. I don\\'t often order dessert but my friend ordered the creme brulé, which was more of a whip with broken up pieces of sugary crust. Of course, I had a taste and it was light and fluffy and delightful. A note about the wine. There were a handful of wines available by the glass and these were all reasonably priced, for example, the Tempranillo was only $10 a glass. PS - Don\\'t let the signage dissuade you. This restaurant will give you one of the most interesting dining experiences at a reasonable price.', 'positive'], ['Yalp — Hola Tapas Bar', 'In searching for an evening out for Tapas, discovered the Hola Cafe, which as it turns out was literally five minutes away. From the outside, the place does not appear that inviting but once inside, Chef Casar Penalver was most ingratiating. The atmosphere is casual and cozy with a grouping of small tables and a large red tile top bar, where we chose to sit and watch the chef at work. In reading some of the reviews on Yelp about portion size, a reminder, this is a tapas bar or small plates. It is not about size but about flavor. The small plates presented by Chef Casar were nothing short of pure genius, making Hola Cafe a rare gem worthy of this 5 star rating. Casar has managed to elevate traditional tapas with his own take using molecular gastronomy and a few other techniques to enhance and coax incredible flavors and textures from his ingredients. We started the meal with \"Olivas\", olives which has been pureed and then reconstituted to take their original shape served on a spoon with a touch of olive oil and a hint of rosemary. ($12). Casar encourages you to eat them as you would an oyster. The flavor and oil was subtle and a most remarkable start to the meal. The Croquetas de Bacalao ($10) were small fried balls of heaven filled with cod sofrito and accompanying red pepper aioli. Crunchy on the outside and packed with layers of flavor on the inside. These were perfectly fried and not at all greasy. The Queso Frito ($10) was unlike any other I have had. Beautifully sculpted and layered on the plate was a seared Haloumi cheese, a touch of ratatouille and topped with an olive tapenade, all accompanied by small fried onions for texture. Perhaps my favorite of the night was Bombones De Alcachofa. ($10) These were literally small bonbons of artichoke served on top of a whipped brie cheese \"salsa\" and topped with a truffle caviar. Each flavor was distinct, subtle and yet melded in a way to present a cohesive dish like no other. Truly exceptional. Other highlights of the evening were ... warmed prosciutto wrapped around a date ($9) with a catelope gel puree with black peppercorn which presented a perfect balance of sweet and savory in one bite; a live rose filled with a gel of rosewater and honey in which smell and taste were intertwined for a sensory delight; and a reconstructed capresa with house dehydrated tomatoes, burata cheese and fresh basil ($14). Chef Casar explained that he could not find tomatoes with the flavor desired, but by using a dehydrator he was more than able to restore the intensity of flavor one looks for in a capresa. Topping off the evening for a desert was Espuma De Crema Catalana ($14), a whipped cream or infused milk foam with orange and lime zest and cookie crumble with a hint of cinnamon. This was seriously so light and delicate and o so good! The sign of a good meal is when the flavors still resonate on your palate long after the meal has concluded.

We ordered a couple of food items, most notably the potato bravas. It was about half a potato cubed and tasted like it was tossed in BBQ powder. All the portions are really tiny for the price and was nothing mind blowing taste wise. The cocktails were also mediocre. When we received our drinks, my wife found her's a bit watery but didn't say anything. The bartender came by, asked her how her drink was and she just said it's ok. He kept pushing her for her true opinion until she finally said that it's actually quite watery. Surprisingly he started defending the watery drink saying it's because the restaurant doesn't have a proper ice machine and they only had bagged ice. We were left wondering why he was prodding so hard if he did not intend to comp. the drink, or remake it. It was quite strange. So we left there a bit baffled at the pricing, the drinks situation and also all the 5 star reviews. Over all, the owner is super friendly, the restaurant has cool vibe for just hanging out but is very overpriced for what you get.

She asked which size snow fluff and I decided large. She let me know it would be 10-15 minutes for the toast and they were out of vanilla ice cream and using vanilla snow fluff instead. I sat down with the kids and started playing jenga. After a short while she brought out our snow fluff, small size. I reminded her i ordered large so she made us the large and let us keep the small. As far as the fluff it was tasty, till you got below the syrup topping. It's as if the snow had little to no flavor but they made up for it by using some kind of syrup then condensed milk. The panna cotta was surprisingly delish, I almost ordered more! The coffee jelly was good, not too solid. After a while our toast came out and besides the snow fluff they subbed for vanilla ice cream it was good. I sorta spent my entire visit thinking of things I would do to make that place killer. There aren't too many boba places in our area. The concept is great, the restaurant is very nicely decorate, and the menu is doable!

The thai tea wasnt good at all from what he told me, first he tried it with their sea salt cream foam, but it was too light and then with regular half and half cream. It looked very watered down and he said it was bland tasting. As for his greet tea macha float, he had described as floral traditional green tea but stronger. It didnt honestly look too good, like green water and a plop of ice cream melting in it, like a water float. My snow ice sensation was very bland, the ice cream scoop in it was good but the snow had very little to no taro taste at all; very watered down, and the texture was not fluffy but more of a crushed freezer ice texture, not worth 5 bucks in my opinion. The mango sensation was good and for a large was very decently sized, that was the only redeeming order of that day.

The space is funky, at least for this neighborhood, and the coffee house tries to be gourmet, but there are numerous failings. First, and it may seem trivial, but when you walk into a dark cave of a space in the summer, you don\\'t want to see garish \"cool white\" CFL light bulbs in the track lighting. Track lighting is meant to give warm, pinpoint accent lighting and the CFL\\'s are harsh and blue. Second, I ordered a BLT imagining it would be hard to screw up this sandwich. I sat and waited way too long as the ladies behind the counter chatted away. After more than 10 minutes someone yelled out \"did someone order a BLT?\" gesturing at the counter, where my sandwich had obviously been sitting for a while. At no point in the ordering process did they tell me how my sandwich would be delivered or announced. Apparently I was supposed to watch the counter. On to the sandwich. The BLT came on flavorless, doughy-white ciabatta type of bread and had lettuce hanging out a good two inches on all sides. The ingredients were jammed in in an unceremonious fashion, but nevermind, I thought. If it tastes good, I am happy. After folding the lettuce over so that I could actually take a bite, I realized that the bacon was extremely salty and tough. I lifted off the bread and saw that they had used bacon shaped into rounds, obviously manufactured for use on bacon cheeseburgers and other fast-food nastiness. The bacon was so salty and nasty that I couldn\\'t taste the rest of the sandwich and literally had to choke the thing down. I\\'m afraid that Java Cat really falls short in a city that aspires to much more. Just down the road Crema Café does everything much better, with a flourish and a flair and with a real sense of customer service.

They're other dessert options too such as cookies, cakes, pies, tarts, biscotti's, brownies, macaroons etc. Most of these desserts are really pricey though. For example, a small piece of cake is $5-$6. Personally, I love their gigantic cookies ($1.95), their crunchy from the outside and chewy on the inside.

I had heard from friends that their drinks were very sweet, but I think this only applies to the fruit teas.

I won\\'t delve too much into the process of creating your drink, but you pay for each ingredient you pick with some certain limits and restrictions. I combined matcha and raspberry powder for my milk tea and was told twice that it was a risky combination. Little did they know I like living life on the edge. After waiting an hour in line, paying ~$7 for my drink, telling myself \"ignore the haters, you have great taste and this drink is gonna be revolutionary\" and receiving my finished concoction, all I could say was \"WOW! This is bland! I\\'m disappointed!\" Not a hint of matcha, but that might be because it was overpowered by the not-raspberry raspberry flavour. I did try my friend\\'s and it, too didn\\'t blow my socks off. Would I come back to try another combination? Nah. I really did want to like this place, but there\\'s better quality bubble tea without the gimmicks, so I don\\'t think I\\'ll be returning.', 'negative'], ['Yalp — Labothéry', \"Cool but sorta broken concept. The entire set up is cafeteria style where you pick and choose exactly what you want to go in your beverage sort of making this a very personal type of concept. After going thru what's what and if I can put this with that. I chose matcha and coconut powder base, 60% sugar with milk and in a slushy format. It didn't turn out the way I would've wanted it to, the flavours were very muted and although my drink was green it didn't have a matcha taste AT ALL. My girlfriend got a peach mango green tea with mango boba and it was actually pretty good. The total for the two drinks was $13 tax in which is a little more expensive than competitors down the street. until they change how they have their tapioca laid out I would recommend AGAINST getting it as a topping because it's just hard and chewy when it is left out the way it is. The staff were friendly guiding thru the steps with unfamiliar customers. They have 2-3 baristas working making the line more bearable considering it moved in a decent pace. The tea-shop is not crammed at all and is easy to navigate thru as it is vey spaced out. Overall I would give another chance but coming here would not be my first opinion so who knows when that is going to happenS .\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — Labothéry', 'Went last night to check it out and the line was quite long.

It\\'s a little expensive for bubbletea but the flavours were good and the experience/ decor is interesting It\\'s $3.25 for a cup, $1/flavour, $0.50/topping and you get a choice of oolong, black and green tea. One thing I didn\\'t like was customer service. They were quite slow with the drinks and the cashier made me second guess my order.

This is basically a lab-themed bubble tea shop where you pick your own flavors and toppings. You pick a hot or cold drink, flavor profile, sugar (white/brown/maple syrup - 10/20/30%), milk, and tapioca vs jelly (different flavors). I'll give them credit for trying a new concept in a city where aesthetic is everything, but they still need to iron a lot of wrinkles out. Honestly it's pretty confusing what flavors you can/can't combine, and the guy at the front explaining can't keep up with the volumes of customers. Essentially you can't combine the syrup flavors (cold drink) with the powder flavors (hot drinks) and can pick up to 1 or 2 flavors depending on if you get a hot or cold drink. I went with two other people, and we all tried different flavors but came to the same conclusion - the flavors do not mix well at all! My matcha coconut milk tea didn't come out as expected at all, and my friends said the same for their drinks. Price wise, this place is ridiculously expensive. I get it - you're paying for the novelty of the concept but charging $3.25 for a cup, $1 per flavor, $0.5-1 for milk, and $1 per topping means that each drink comes out to around $7-8. The only thing that's free is the sugar, and even that costs extra if you want maple syrup instead of white/brown sugar. There are much better bubble tea places in the city that don't break the bank!\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — Labothéry', \"Went here for the first time and had such a fun experience. If it's your first time there someone usually helps you out pick whether you want a fruit tea or milk tea and how much sugar you would like either reg, brown sugar or maple syrup. They even notice your flavors that you choose and will even tell you which ones go best together. It's a bit on the pricey side since they charge per flavor and topping. I got two toppings, two flavors and soy milk so it added up to about $8 for milk tea and there's only one size just letting you know.

No, i\\'m not talking about % of sugar, or % of ice you can add, but your entire drink. You can mix flavors you would not be able to do so at another franchise, and add as many toppings as you\\'d like (from what they offer). The science lab theme of this place is also unique and makes it really cute. As a science graduate myself, the syringes, petri dishes, test tubes, sample jars etc was funny to me, but I\\'m sure it adds to the experience for others. You start off with a sterile tray, picking either a hot/cold cup for your drink. They also instruct you on how many test tube (of tea flavors) to add to your drink (2x for cold drinks, 1x for hot). You move on to a slew of test tube tray racks, where you can choose which tea flavor you\\'d like. The choices range from fruity flavors (peach etc) to milk tea powders (durian, red bean etc). You can also choose your level of sweetness with various types of sugar too (regular sugar syrup, brown sugar etc). Around the corner, you\\'ll get to choose your toppings (boba - the ones that explode in your mouth, pearls - what they described as harder than tapoica, jelly etc) in petri dishes. They also have evaporated milk as an option, which they recommended based off your customized drink to enhance the flavor and add some creaminess. Finally, when you get to the register, you have an option of a 3 different tea bases. I found it a cute touch how each of the cups have \"DR.\" printed on them, where they write your name on it (so they call you as \"DR. _____\"). My friends and I all chose a milk tea, which we all agreed was not as spectacular as we would have expected. However, I\\'ve heard that their customized fruity teas are really enjoyable, so I\\'m looking forward to going back and giving those a try. I usually get a small size at any bbt place I go to, but unfortunately at this place they only offer 1 size.', 'negative'], ['Yalp — Labothéry', \"Decided to check out Labothery after someone in my Yelp Facebook group let us in on the secret about this place. It looks like they recently launched and they offer your typical powder and syrup bubble tea, but everything is made to look like you are picking samples from a scientist's laboratory. The staff are dressed in white lab coats and it looks like they are mixing secret chemicals together to concoct your drink. The lab is quite spacious with barstool type seating. Upon entering you are supposed to pick up a small metal tray and start by deciding whether you want a cold or hot drink. Then you pick different ingredients, which are packaged in little tubes or syringes for your drink. I found that the staff were not so helpful in making recommendations for the drinks and as this place gets busier, I can see that it will be difficult to ensure that the line-ups of indecisive but intrigued customers can be moved quickly. Instructions on what can be picked are uncleared and it's only when we got to the counter that they told us that some of the ingredients chosen would not go well together.

I totally \"milked\" the system. I work near their Tempe location, but live near this Scottsdale location, so on Free Salad Day, 25Jun15, I went to 1 location for lunch, and for dinner I went to this location. It was after 7pm, but there was still a line wrapped around the corner. There were water misters (my hair wasn\\'t happy about that) blowing on the crowd to keep them cool and they also had flavored water dispensers to keep you hydrated in the heat. Employees were nice, helpful, and the free-day was a well-organized event. I ended up getting the same dish that I had at the other location, because I liked it so much. It was a veganized Don Quixote (and if ONE more person mispronounced his name in that line, I was gonna scream!): baby greens, Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu (instead of meat), roasted corn, avocado (with MAD spice), mango, green onions (instead of cheese), and the Roasted Red Pepper Dressing (instead of the non-vegan creamy \"something\" that came with it). I ended up saving it for lunch the next day, and I agree with the other Yelper about the wilting greens. It was definitely soupy the next day, but it had been swimming in dressing (plus, I requested a lot of dressing) 16 hours so I won\\'t complain. Everything was still tasty the next day, and the avocados were still green (you know an avocado will turn on you quickly). VEGANS: For protein options, they have... 1 - Organic Grilled Piri Piri Tofu - These are chunks of firm tofu (with a slight squish factor), but the taste is excellent (and I am no tofu fan). I was told that they marinate their organic tofu for 24 hours; this is what gives it such great flavor. 2 - Grilled Portobellos (if mushrooms are your thang). 3 - Warm Quinoa. There are lots of fruits, veggies, and nuts as well. Avoid the Paninis! The bread is not vegan (their sourdough bread contains whey). VEGAN SALAD DRESSINGS - There is a print out by the dressings which shows you which ones are vegan. Note: if it says \"Vegan*\" -WITH an asterisk sign, that means the dressing has honey. Pure vegan dressings will not have the asterisk. I suggest checking out their online interactive \"allergen\" menu; you can click everything that you want to omit and they\\'ll produce a qualifying list of items. You can then click on each to see exactly what ingredients are used. Know before you go! (The Balsamic Vinaigrette, Sherry Molasses Vinaigrette, and Roasted Red Pepper are among the pure vegan options.) Lastly, keep your eyes on your bowl as they add ingredients. I told the guy at the cash register that I was vegan so I\\'d be swapping non-vegan items for vegan items in my salad. I watched the girl and as soon as I saw her go for the cheese I started waving my hands profusely and saying, \"No, no NO!\" Too late. Cheese in the bowl. \"I told him vegan...\" I said with a sad face. She was like, \"No worries.\" She tossed that bowl, told cashier-guy what he should add to the ticket for vegans, then she got me a brand new bowl and re-made my salad. No attitude. No bother.

Thought they would get a kick out of the 'eat with your hands' style. The food is quite tasty. We like spicy and they delivered on that quite well. It is a popular place and you will often see many cabs parked outside, but that's not necessarily because of tourists flocking there. It's mainly because of the high number of Ethiopian cab drivers that Las Vegas has. If you have never had Ethiopian food, served traditionally, keep in mind that it is served family style and with Injera used as the only food vessel/utensil. Injera is basically like a sour thin pancake/thick tortilla. We ordered the vegetable combo and meat combo. It is served on a big plate that is also covered in Injera. Like I said, the food is tasty and I strongly recommend it if you want to try authentic Ethiopian food. Now, the downsides: It is most certainly not the cleanest restaurant. Though the floor and tables appeared pretty clean, the walls, and fixtures are all quite dirty and dusty. Also, the bathrooms are borderline gross. The men's bathroom had no towels or toilet paper. The service is a bit slow and refills on water come once at best. Very friendly though. The restaurant is quite warm and they burn incense which is pretty potent. Also, the clientele is mainly Ethiopian so if you're not Ethiopian, be prepared to be stared at a bit by the clientele as you enter. Since you eat with your hands, I would expect a wet towel or something to rinse your hands with when you get there or when you are done, but neither are offered. Drinks are not served from a tap or soda fountain so no free refills on anything except ice water.

Sunday, just past 2pm. We drive into the ghetto strip mall (which I love when it comes to food). People are leaving from the establishment as we arrive. And.. we walk in. The place is empty. Well, there were two females one older and bitter, one younger and chipper... but the place was empty of customers. We choose a table with our son, get the high chair, and wait.

So obviously, you don't get any utensils to eat with your meal. My lamb was really tough which definitely took away from my experience.

We just looked for restaurants in his cars GPS, and to my surprise there was an Ethiopian place near by! I often eat at one of the many excellent Ethiopian restaurants in Los Angeles, but had never seen one in Vegas.... Until that faithful day. If you like hole in the wall type places that offer excellent ethnic food, this place will not disappoint. I've eaten here about 8 times now, and have yet to have a bad meal.

The tibs and wat (beef or lamb) are both beautifully spiced and prepared. The Doro wat (chicken stew with egg) is also excellent. The little salad that is served with all meals has a nice dressing, and a little tomato for added sweetness. All of the vegetarian options are available as well, and are just as good. Today I had the pleasure of sampling their Ethiopian coffee! Perfect. Strong and sweet, with no milk. They prepare it in a special kettle by hand on a small range / open fire right in the middle of the restaurant.

A meal with soda clocks in at about 10 bucks with tax, and you'll probably have some left overs. The service has always been friendly, and prompt.

I love Ethiopian dishes, they are so warm, savory, and spicy - with complex flavors (I wouldn\\'t even know where to start to imitate it at home), and the tangy, yeasty injera (spongy crepe-like bread) rocks my world.

It\\'s about a ten minute cab ride away, it\\'s cheap and they have delicious fake meat. Delicious.

Hahaha!\\' and they laughed and laughed. Good one, you guys! It IS hilarious when someone is vegan! HAR DEE FUCKING HAR HAR. we pull up to Long Life Vege and the motherfucker is closed. GODDAMMIT. we ask our cabbie for restaurant recommendations and he suggests Merkato since it is nearby and he is a regular. We get to Merkato and as we are getting out of the cab, both my dad and I realize that we forgot our wallets. Well, actually, my dad forgot his wallet and I \"forgot\" mine, you dig? I ain\\'t paying when money bags is around! I wrangle dogs for a living and my father gets hundred dollar bills poured on his head just for waking up.

Both VERY good signs for potential deliciousness. I order the veggie combo (which was a very typical veggie combo: yellow lentils, red lentils, mustard greens, enjera salad, etc) and it was MAGNIFICENT. One of the best i\\'ve had and I\\'ve had A LOT. my dad got the dead lambert and said the flavor was fantastic but there was too much fat and gristle. now, contrary to popular belief, i haven\\'t always been vegan. i used to eat meat and let me tell you, i liked the grossest meat. tendons and gristle and marrow...i mean, i would CLEAN a chicken bone and then use a splinter to pick my teef. i was a hardcore red neck of an obese 9 year-old until i figured out i was eating bambi. ANYWAY, if you are currently like i was when i was 9 years-old, then get the lamb and when you\\'re done, have your cholesterol checked because i\\'m pretty sure you\\'re gonna drop dead at any moment. So, we finish our fantastic meal about 15 hours after we first walked in (that\\'s how they roll in Ethiopia. Slowly. But friendly. Like this review.) and as he\\'s paying, my dad realizes that instead of the $30 tip he thought he left our lovable cabbie, he gave him $115 tip. MY DAD\\'S BAD! we also realized that we had no way back to the hotel. luckily when i asked our waitress to call us a cab, she was all, \"hold on\" and disappears. two minutes later, a guy who was eating a few tables over has us in his cab, headed back to the hotel.

This quaint little cafe is located next to the George Brown campus, with modern minimalist decor. Front of cafe seating is all single tables and back of cafe seating is more friendly for catching up with friends. I came by mostly to try the matcha red bean roll cake - being a big fan of both, and of course the slush drink commonly found at bubble tea cafes, I was curious to see how the dessert equivalent was executed. Verdict? Not so sweet which I liked, but the matcha flavour was a little lacking and there was very little red bean to add to the flavour combo. The service was mostly friendly, the barista/owner suggested an SprOld Fashioned to my friend (think the cocktail with espresso substitute for the liquor) and a Lovely Latte for myself (don't be fooled by the name, this is just a regular, no frills latte). My friend thought his drink was interesting,and I thought my drink was a little weak on the espresso. Total for two roll cakes and two drinks with tax+tip came out to just under $20.

Phil & Sebastian so far is the best coffee I've found in Calgary. These guys clearly are from the Third Wave Coffee ilk and uphold that tradition with excellence. My first experience with P&S was at the Calgary Farmer's Market and from that point it was clear that these guys knew what they were doing. Let's do the technical details run down: - Locally roasted coffee beans: Check. They have their own roaster in Calgary - Baristas with proper training on pulling espresso Check.

Not too long ago, I stopped in with a friend, and she purchased me a cup of tea. I was happy to see that they were using an actual steeping device with loose leaf, like many other specialty tea shops use for tea to go. I personally am not a fan of these devices as they are plastic, and often carelessly cleaned at establishments I've seen in the past. However, my tea came out tasting okay, and it was worth waiting a couple minutes as opposed to being served bagged tea. I would rather be sipping on said tea while shopping for potatoes and brussel sprouts at the aforementioed old farmer's market than Chinook Mall, but I guess I can consider this a place to hide and read if I am ever dragged to Chinook.

Since the price of these items are priced like a regular entree, I feel that they are asking for a few dollars too much. We decided to order 4 dishes for the two of us. We shared a Winter Greens salad, which tasted fine until I noticed that there were pomegranate seeds in it (not listed as an ingredient on the menu), which gave a very unplesant crunch with the angel hair collard greens. The eggplant byaldi was just ok, there was nothing special about it. We then had the whole cornish hen, which came with piri piri sauce. We thought the hen was done well and tasted good, and liked the veggies and farro that accompanied it. The grilled octopus was also done well and had a spicy kick to it, perhaps too much. I was pleased that is was not over-done and was very tender.

Snacks, hipster music and staff, great spirits, passable beer, and more than enough in the general atmosphere to make up for a somewhat unexpectedly limited wine list. I'll start with some of the cons. As I alluded above, the wine list isn't great. And I don't expect a casual snack bar to have a long list of stunners. But offer some neat stuff by the glass, at least. More than two or three, and more than almost exclusively VQA pours. It doesn't make sense with the rest of the cosmopolitan menu. Additionally, I really wanted to order from the snack menu at lunch and wasn't able to. I've had Ibérico before and really wanted to see how they presented it, and was disappointed to hear I could only order from the lunch menu. But I got past it. I had the warm mushroom and arugula salad with added seared hen. The salad was terrific and I wasn't expecting it to be. It was curiously arranged, with all the mushrooms and dressing buried underneath a pile of arugula and pinenuts. At first I thought this amounted to poor presentation, but it actually made sense. The arugula stayed fresh, vital, and crisp by not warming up, and this contrasted and paired perfectly with delicious warm, assorted mushrooms, accented nicely by a soy-based dressing and the sharp manchego. The hen was a little dry, but Portland made up for that with a nice accompanying sauce, spicy and tangy. It was served incredibly quickly which means that the hen is pre-cooked, but I understand that. I drank a Cafe Biscotti to start, then had a nice bottle of Italian beer, Collesi. The former was a nice warm-up after an enormous windy blizzard, and the latter was a great, dry friend to accompany my book and light lunch. Both were very nice and unique. The decor and atmosphere of the place is definitely great. Light hipster music playing softly, like Cults or Passion Pit, with a beautiful white marble bar and bright natural lighting contrasting mostly black furniture. Very modern, very cool.

I had ten minutes to kill at work, so after consulting Yelp for the closest cafe, I walked down the street to Reba\\'s to get a shot. It looked promising online, boasting organic fair trade beans. Upon walking in, my eyes scanned the bar and my immediate reaction was to retrace my steps out the door when I saw the home (as in not professional) espresso machine. I didn\\'t have time to go back to work and search out another cafe in this unfamiliar neighbourhood, so I decided to bear it, but not without suggesting first to the \"barista\" that the shop really needed to upgrade their machine as they weren\\'t doing their lovely selection of beans any justice. His response was \"you\\'d be surprised\". I asked for a double shot. He loaded it up, ran a shot and was about to run a second blast of water through the same head with the same used grinds (ummm) when I quickly stopped him and said \"no, no, that will be fine\". As any other espresso aficionado may have guessed, I was NOT surprised. As not to be insulting (I could have pulled a Badalamenti, Mulholland drive performance http://movieclips.com/y5A6-mulholland-dr-movie-bad-coffee/ ) I drank my glorified drip coffee and paid up with another \"cafe\" crossed off in my mental notebook. If you\\'re looking for a good shot, look elsewhere. It\\'s a shame that this place has to do so poorly in this area because everything else seemed great about it. The food looked good, the wholesale beans looked good, the rooms looked good (the reasons I gave two stars instead of one). The bottom line is that If you\\'re going to have the word \"cafe\" in your name (a European term, and in Europe coffee=espresso) then I think you should have your espresso game honed.

But they also offer Minestrone soup as well which I havent try ... should i try that next time or should I stick with mushroom.. wish I have more than 1 stomach. :) A recommended item from me! For the Lasagna, it\\'s all veggie and vegan cheese. i don\\'t know what they put in there but boy, its good!! another recommended item from me! As for the potato Croquette, it is served with some kind of Apple sauce and also some white \"creamy\" sauce that have a little kick from the cayenne pepper (I think it\\'s cayenne pepper). I dont know what\\'s in the white sauce but it sure looks like cream sauce but I am sure they didn\\'t use any cream as it\\'s dairy free.

They did say to me last time that when their spring/summer menu comes out they will add bbt). They also have free wifi :) First impressions: place was clean, tidy, and bright. You don't always get that when you go to resturants in Chinatown. Decor was simplistic like a casual cafe you can go to to do some work or relax. Staff was very friendly, all smiles and greeted you as you came in. It felt like a family owned shop type of feel and I really like that. You also see the crepe making area as soon as you get in, like most crepe places, the work area looked cleaned which is always good. They also have their gelatos lined for you to see as soon as you walked in which made me more excited to try out their gelatos. They have around 5 or 6 gelatos flavors to choose from and some ice cream. Price: pretty decent for crepes. They range from 7$ to 9$ before tax depending on what you get. They also serve hot drinks and teas, I thought the price was decent and fair. Drinks typically 3-7$ range, again depends on what you get. You can also buy gelato by the scoop without the crepes for 4$. Service: very friendly and approachable, open to suggestions (they asked how the crepes were - we had ordered one meat lover crepe and a gelato party crepe. The meat lover crepe had too much mayo on it, we let her know to put less next time and she was very receptive to that suggestion saying they just opened and don't mind any feedback we had. The next time we came in we ordered the same and they had changed how much mayo they now put on it. I have since order the same crepe a few times and have no complaints. I like how when you order tea they use nice tea cups and their tea lists shows how much caffeine and antioxidants each tea has (I.e., low, moderate etc.) Taste: I gotta say I am a big fan of their crepes, it's definitely on the thicker side which I like compared to other crepes. My fave is the gelato party, it has fruits, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and your choice of a scoop of their gelato. It's a good portion size that definitely satisfies my sweet tooth! Overall I'm really enjoying this place and what it has to offer. It's perfect for a cute date or to go to do some work, (it has jazz music in the background that's provides a relaxing ambiance, sometimes I don't even notice the music playing which is what I prefer).

There is are upstairs/downstairs/patio areas and a decent sized bar. The decor is modeled after (you guessed it) an old school train station. The owner has obviously dedicated a lot of time, money, and effort to convert this space. Stop by and check it for yourself.

The Malted Meeple is a wonderful place for people to come together, play board games, and drink milkshakes, craft beers, and cocktails. They have some smaller fares, like soft pretzels, soup, and shepherds pie, but they're mostly great for liquid calories. You are allowed to stay as long as you want and play all of the games you want for $5 a person, which isn't a big deal, since all of the games are upkept and in good condition. Our waiter was really great and recommended stuff on their super large menu! He was super attentive. All the staff was really kind and helpful with all of the games. While it was somewhat overwhelming, they answered all of our questions! I had a Chocolate Chip Wookie milkshake with Bailey's added and it was delicious. After a few games, I had a health potion cocktail. It was fruit flavors mixed with rum - it was super sugary and definitely wasn't as good as the milkshake. I can't wait to go back to the Malted Meeple and try more of the games and more of the milkshakes, mixed drinks, and coffee drinks. It's a great fun environment and concept. Definitely one of my new favorites in town. Just don't come expecting dinner or lunch - they don't have food food. They also have a ton of parking in front, so don't worry about that.

The milkshakes were super tasty (I got the emerald ewok) - very foamy and just the right amount of lime and sweetness in mine, and I enjoyed the selection of games offered and the wide, open spacings between tables that helped with sound carry/isolating groups but making you feel like part of a community as well. It looked like a haunted house from the outside (not well lit and the entrance was out back) but it was nice and bright and open on the inside. The tables were pretty large, making it easy to play with 4 people, and the environment was pretty chill and easy-going. It would have been pretty special if the pretzels we ordered were the soft pretzel kind and not the hard, store bought kind - but I do get it, with avoiding messes on board games and all. It gets a little pricey with the cover fee + snack up charge though (so I'm not sure about Yelp's suggested one $ business) but when you go in expecting it - or if these snacks were signature in some way, it's not so bad then.

We played four games and he help us set up and explained the rules for each game. In the excitement of a game, one of the kids accidentally knocked over their drink. Carrington was immediately over to clean up the spill. Several other group had children as well, and all appeared to having an enjoyable time.

But I've decided to go the generous route, at least until I visit some other board game bars to do a comparison. We came on a Sunday shortly after they opened. Unfortunately, they don't serve alcohol on Sundays (but we knew this going in since it's clearly displayed on their website). We tried the milkshake flight (3 new flavors they're auditioning to be next month's FOM). For August it includes red velvet, brownie, and birthday cake. Honestly, they all tasted pretty much the same to me, and they were rather boring. We also got some buffalo popcorn, which was fine. I would have much rather had something more substantial to snack on, or nutritious even. But their menu options are very limited to things like popcorn, chips, candy, etc. A cheese plate or some crudités would go a long way here, in my opinion. Anyway, you don't come here for the food or drinks, you come for the games. They have a fine selection, which is organized by category. My husband had already studied their game menu online before coming (which he said is a huge plus for this place compared to other game board bars), so we knew what we wanted to play and didn't really do much browsing. I would think that the ease-of-browsing/selecting makes a big difference in your overall experience (like it would at a bookstore or library), so my review is lacking in that aspect. Overall I'd say this place is great just because I love the idea of a board game bar. But it's also the only one I've been to, so I can't say if it's better or worse than the other options in the area.\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — The Malted Meeple', 'Quick planning details for you: -They don\\'t serve meals, just snacks, so plan to eat before/after you go. -Can\\'t bring in outside food either (e.g. pizza). Rules could be different if you\\'re setting up a formal event with them; didn\\'t do this, so not sure. -Can bring your own games. -Will loan out their games. Great venue for hanging out to play games with friends, or trying out some new games. 4 of my friends and I brought in Firefly last Friday night after dinner and played from 7-11, and everybody had fun. We were able to walk right in and grab a table. The place got busier as the night got later; there was just 1 other group when we first arrived, but it was almost full when we left. Atmosphere is basically like a geeky gaming/comics shop that conveniently also has a bar. This is in contrast with other \"bar-first\" gaming places which are bars that also conveniently have games. If you are looking for a hipstery or edgy bar scene that does games, this is probably not your place. Even though we brought our own, they have an awesome selection of games. List is on their website. Noise-level was great for playing games, throughout the night. At its busiest, it grew to be about on par with a typical sit-down restaurant. There is not music, TVs, or kitchen noise to talk over either, which helps. I had never played Firefly before, so needed the rules explained and had questions while playing, and never had to ask my friends to repeat themselves because of noise. Crowd was mostly 20-30 somethings, but there was also a family that brought kids, and a group with some older adults, so the place seems friendly for all ages. As another reviewer pointed out, it was not all men either. Food-wise, I had a delicious \"Dagoba Swamp\" milkshake, which was basically Oreos, vanilla ice cream, and mint blended together, with an awesome piece of half un-blended Oreo at the \"bottom of the swamp\". Milkshakes also come in an $18 mega size, which is about the size of a small fish bowl. $18 seemed a little too high for what it was, so I did not order one myself. We also ordered pretzels and buffalo popcorn, and the portion size was pretty generous for both - good for about 2/3 people. Chocolate truffles were good but very tiny, probably not worth the $2 a piece. Having waiters is really nice for a place like this. Really great not to have to leave the game to go to the bar to get another drink or snacks and then have to wait until your drink is ready to return. Only negative about the experience is that a few of us felt bugged a bit to buy drinks by one of the waiters, which was disruptive to our game. It wasn\\'t a huge deal, but given that there is a $5 table fee per person, and that most of us were regularly ordering stuff, it felt a bit unneeded. I think checking if we need anything, and moving on if we decline, is enough; no need to persist. I imagine this is just a kink that will get ironed out after they\\'re in business a while. Definitely don\\'t let it stop you from coming. All-in-all we had a really great time though, and definitely plan to return again!', 'positive'], ['Yalp — The Malted Meeple', \"Before we went my wife made both of us a dinner of salmon burgers grilled with terriyaki and served with waffle cut fries. They were amazing and our cat begged way too much salmon of us, but I couldn't blame him as it was quite tasty. After dinner was over she agreed to come with me to visit a new gaming cafe in the area, The Malted Meeple. I say in the area loosely, but the greater Cleveland/Akron area is a big area and it was a bit of a drive. Not knowing what kind of games they would have I brought some smaller games for two players along. When we got down there we found the place, though it is a bit set back from the road and I highly suggest looking up its location before you go. Upon entering we were greeted by a nice host, who explained to us there was a five dollar table fee, but other than that you need pay nothing else. He did mention they had a variety of snack foods, shakes, and craft beer. I started out with a water and my wife got a wheat ale. I inspected their game library and noticed that though they had well over a hundred games in their collection, including lots of games I either enjoy or would love to play, they did not have many for two players that were more gamerly. Most of their more interesting games were in the 3-5 player region and felt geared toward groups of that number. Luckily, as I mentioned previously, I had brought some games of my own. We started out with a game of Star Realms, which my wife handily won. While we were playing Star Realms, the host came by with a flight of shakes, similar to a flight of beer, he was showing off. They were the Degeva, the Hoth, and the Tatooine Twist. Once we were finished playing Star Realms we ordered a flight of shakes for ourselves. The Tatooine Twist was sweet and had and orange flavor in it, my wife described it as a orange creamsicle. It was suggested it went with something spicy, like some buffalo popcorn they apparently sold, but having eaten earlier we passed on it. My wife, however, did agree it needed to be paired with something spicy. The Hoth was a malt shake with a subtle spice in it that was really smooth, and Degeva was a cookies and cream with a nice minty flavor. We liked all of them although my favorite was the Hoth and my Lady was most taken by Degeva. The repast being consumed we decided to try another game I had brought, which we both learned on the spot, Biblios. It was a game with some really interesting drafting mechanics and although my wife won, we both agreed that this is one we wanted to play again. I think it has far more depth than it first seems to and it proved quite interesting. When we started setting up our next game, Gravwell, the waiter came by and asked if they could get us anything. We ordered a Mayan Truffle for each of us and received them only a little bit into the game of Gravwell. The truffle was the deep chocolate taste you would expect from a truffle with just a hint of spice at the end, which was a nice touch. That was the finish of a very nice gaming day for me. As far as the Malted Meeple goes I was left with a overall good impression, though I would stress certain points for it. If you go, I would go with a group of three of more. For a smaller group I'm not certain their game library really supports that, unless you bring games of your own. The second point is that this place does not serve lunch or dinner, only snacks. If you are likely to get hungry I would suggest eating before you go. Since this is a game cafe I should probably comment on the tables. They are large with glass surfaces and a raised ridge. While I would have preferred a cloth surface with a bit more texture for traction, the glass surface was not a huge problem. One nice feature was the raised edges of the table, making it harder for dice or cards to slide off of them. These are the only negatives though, and I'm not sure if my comments on the table are not somewhere in between, rather than being a negative. They have tons of good games in their library for 3-5 player groups and from what I could see of the other tables the staff seems to have some familiarity with the games. I did not get to personally ask them to teach a game, but I may make a point of doing so at some point in the future. A big positive for me was the environment and the staff. The feel of the place left one feeling gaming was a refined activity for adults and young adults. It was very welcoming to dates and women and there were, in fact, a number of women there. This paired with an extensive snack and craft brew menu left one feeling they could spend hours here in mixed company or with more casual gamers and everyone could walk away remembering the experience very favorably. Overall I was impressed and for the groups I described, I will likely go here in the future.\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — The Merseyside', \"That was AWFUL.

I saw a lot of people arrive to just do take out of food or a drink and each time they were greeted quickly with a smile. Flat White - I was glad to see Propeller coffee beans served here. With the Turbo (darker roast), I knew the flavour would be richer than the one I had experienced. I found the flat white to be decent but it was really more of a latte as it had a lot of milk to dilute the espresso shot. It's a good latte flavour but definitely missing the boldness of a true flat white. 3/5 Chocolate Madeleine cookies - Made in house, these were the texture of a super rich brownie. So for all those who love a fudgey brownie texture, this would be good for you. As for flavour, it had a super bold bitter dark chocolate taste. A very rich cocoa with very little sweetness. I found it a perhaps too bitter for a cookie since I was asking which of their baked good was the sweetness. Still a great texture ... just could have used a tad more sweet to balance the cocoa. 3/5 Nice little neighbourhood spot for those who don't want the crowds and a decent cup.

This is definitely 5 stars - affordable prices, healthy, fresh foods that make you feel like you went to your parents' house for a meal. They have their regular menu and 3-4 specials that are written on a chalkboard (and also on their website). The prices are reasonable too - I got soup and my salad for just about $10, which is what you would pay at the airport for some mediocre, bland salad. I got a delicious broccoli lentil soup that was hearty and healthy (just pureed vegetables and lentils), with a hint of curry. It tasted homemade (I imagine it was), and was perfect to battle the cold outside. The kale salad was good too - with cabbage, avocado, almonds & dried cranberry. There was a little bit too much dressing on there for my taste, but I should've gotten it on the side. Great customer service too - everyone was super friendly and nice. And when the cashier discovered I was going to dine-in, she came over to my table and brought me silverware. Complete with a smile and some nice chit-chat - these basic things are often not found elsewhere.

As we spoke, it became evident that the crazy good food was not a mere accident or anomaly. She's been doing this a while and it shows. When I think of 5 Stars, I don't think of high dollar, fancy, or lobster...I think of fresh ingredients, creative dishes, unique bold flavors, and lastly but perhaps most importantly, it has to be executed with precision. That is EXACTLY what I found at The Mission Eatery. With a variety of meals, from the hearty meaty, to the hearty vegan, there is a fit for everyone. Although I am not a vegan, I was lured into the vegan portobello mushroom and cheddar melt. It was absolutely fantastic. For a small add on price, I got their Mission salad. Perfectly balanced with a variety of ingredients and dressing (again, they nailed it with the dressing...not too dry, but not at all soggy). For years, I used to avoid getting stuck at this layover during a lunch or dinner meal time.

I was surprised when my soup arrived to find a chilled fruit soup. I flagged down the waiter immediately and said that although I had indeed ordered \"the soup\", their sign said it was potato and cheddar.

We didn\\'t see him again until he brought us the cheque, featuring my soup at full price. I went to investigate and sure enough, he had located the incorrect sign and changed it to say \"Watermelon Soup (COLD)\". Given that it was raining and I was having only soup for dinner, watermelon soup was really not ideal. I\\'ve worked as a waiter for several years and I was surprised to find that my rather unsatisfying cold soup dinner had not been comped given that the error was clearly theirs.

I had the vegetable curry after the server said the chef is Indian. It was pretty good but not as good as what I'd get from a decent Indian restaurant...but I wasn't at a decent Indian restaurant! It was a tad pricey at $24 but I would definitely go back to try more dishes. Hubby had the mussels and received a huge portion that would have fed 2-3 folks. He liked it. The chef was kind enough to prepare the youngest an off menu grilled cheese and fries since that's what she was craving. #1 had the lemon garlic chicken and said it was good. One of the servers let the kiddos pick candy from the candy case and gave us the last piece of coconut cream pie in the glass pie dish.

When we first got there our priorities were more along the lines of WASHROOM! WASHROOM!, but once we took care of that we were more than a little intrigued by this busy, but well staffed diner. The menu is pretty brief with 6-10 each of apps, mains, and dessert, but everything looked good and there wasn't a lot of overlap in terms of types of foods/flavours. The restaurant itself is also pretty cool with old coke machines and napkin dispensers, lots of wood everywhere and some cool artwork on the walls. Has a classic feel to it without feeling old. I had the braised beef short rib on a bed of mashed potatoes with some julienned carrots and parsnips(?) on the side all surrounded by an incredibly flavourful gravy. The worst thing I can say about this dish is that there WASN'T ENOUGH! Haha. The beef just fell apart, the mashed potatoes and gravy were great and even the veggies on the side left me wanting more. It was also pretty perfectly portioned and plated. Not too big, but more than filling and it made me hungry just to look at it. My buddy Phil's burger looked pretty awesome too. Big and greasy. And, until I tasted my dish, I was a little jealous! Next time... Also, it was pretty packed and we were lucky to get seated as fast as we did, so make reservations if you're planning on going during prime hours.

OKAY... so I digress, the point is: I like the fact The Senator is Toronto's oldest diner and because of it, I really, really, R-E-A-L-L-Y wanted to like it. Alas, this locale, sans it's picturesque history is nothing more than average. I took someone here a few weeks ago, and granted the place is cute in that 1960's kinda decour but her Eggs Benedict were, well, atrocious. The recipe was just badly executed and it tasted salty and sour. The Hollandaise if it could be called that was sub par at best. She is really too nice a person (don't know why) to send it back and so we shared some of my French Toasts which unfortunately were so sweet that I am still waiting for the Type 2 Diabetes to hit me like a Mack truck...you know, any day now. Their egg dishes are average at best. Sure they are not bad but I had the same quality at Jonny G's or The Coach House but for 40% less. I attended a Yelp event here a few days ago and again, the decour is very good. I find it charming and spot on but not enough to loose your head over. However the food, although well intentioned was still just okay. Their crab cakes tasted a bit better than store bought and as far as their Mac and Cheese, my companion said she could easily make better. Sliders were good but not exceptional. So all in all, the restaurant suffers specially when you pick up a menu and compare their prices to the competition. Oh Senator, I appreciate they open silly-early in the morning, you know, for a real breakfast however in the end, the major factor is the food and why come here when you will get the same quality at multiple other places less than a 15 minute walk for less? Okay, maybe those other places may not have opened in 1929... but I can live with that.

Let me tell you a secret. This is the best diner coffee I have ever had. Seriously - you need to try this. My over medium eggs were perfect with just a bit of runny yolk and not overdone. Challah toast was slightly sweet and delicious!!! I could eat 10 slices if they gave it to me. Service was super friendly but super slow. I had the time but I saw some customers wait a long time for their order and couldn't even enjoy it when it did come because they needed to get back to work. Not the place to come for lunch if you have an hour lunch break. Because it literally took 45 minutes for the food to come after the order. I didn't mind though. This is the place to come to enjoy great food at great prices with great company. Or if you don't have company, you can easily strike conversations with people around you. Some of their booths are awfully close to one another. My booth was literally side by side with a couple of guys and I could hear their entire conversation. I was super happy after lunch.

It had an arugula pesto, grilled zucchini, roasted peppers, and herbed goat cheese. This summer start actually looked like an open-face sandwich and was very healthy and made with fresh ingredients. All of the ingredients went so well together and I especially liked the herbed goat cheese and the flakey pastry of the tart. The herbed goat cheese was my favourite part of the Grilled Summer Tart! The Compressed Watermelon & Feta Salad had an artisanal lettuce bouquet, basil, mint, edible flowers, aged balsamic drizzle, and olive oil. The ingredients in this were also very fresh and high-quality. It looked so beautiful and colourful too. The edible flowers were delicate orange petals that actually didn't have a detectable flavour at all. The cutest part of this salad was the cubed watermelon that was topped with feta cheese. P and I both thought this combination of sweet juicy watermelon paired with feta was an interesting one. When you have the juicy watermelon paired with the feta, it makes the feta taste differently than when you eat the two separately. The Pickerel was paired with creamy Jerusalem artichoke, French beans, and shaved fennel. This was another beautifully presented dish that looked like fine dining food. The piece of pickerel was topped with the shaved slices of fennel and sat on top of the French beans and artichoke. This seafood dish was the second favourite dish for me. I loved how fresh, moist, and juicy the pickerel was. The seasoning wasn't strong at all which gave way to the freshness of the fish. I was thoroughly delighted with how great the pickerel was prepared and cooked. Kudos to the chef for preparing such a perfect piece of fish! ^_^ We also liked the French beans (so fresh and crunchy) and I liked the shaved fennel. The creamy Jerusalem artichoke was wonderful too and I wish I had a spoon on the side to scoop more of it up to go with each bite. The Strawberry Shortcake was not your typical kind of shortcake in a cake form. Instead, it arrived in a cute dessert sandwich presentation. It was made with a shortcake biscuit, pastry cream, strawberry compote, crème Anglaise, and Chantilly cream. It was a really cute dessert!

First of all this location is great, perched high above Bloor Street looking out at the plebeians below you with an open airy feeling because of the large windows and skylight. My mum, boyfriend, and I ate along the window which was great--not too cold for all you concerned about Canadian winter weather. Our server was fine, nothing special rather pedestrian if I do say so myself. He welcomed us, took our drink orders, and returned to take our orders. No chit-chat which is either good or bad depending on how you like your servers. My main concern was the food. The menu is small which I think is good for an operation like Holts Cafe. Its best to keep it simple and focused. Like Montreal the Toronto location offers the infamous tartines--open-faced Scandinavian inspired sandwiches--on French poilâne bread. I love the tartines but because Toronto only offers 5-6 options (versus 10-12 in Montreal) I opted to try something else. My eyes immediately honed in on the Chicken Pot Pie which was fine. Just fine. Nothing too spectacular. The puff pastry was really quite tasty, but the 'chicken' inside was shredded and rather sad in quantity. I recently had a Chicken Pot Pie at Bannock (in the rapidly improving the Bay on Queen St. W.) which had huge chunks of fresh chicken breast. The Holts incarnation was tasty but gurrrrl I'm hungry, I'm not one of those ladies who like to lunch who pick at their food, drag it around the plate, and then claim rather exuberantly 'I'm full!'. No no I like my meals and I like them filling. My boyfriend had the Holts Burger which was good (I had to steal a bite!) with fries which were actually really good, with a nice sprinkling of spices with an assortment of dips including garlic aioli mayo (my favourite!). My mum had a tartine (the Grilled Chicken) but unfortunately it seemed like the chicken was of the 'lunch meat' variety rather than slices of chicken breast. The Montreal tartines with chicken had a different kind of chicken and I was a little disappointed by this variation. Although each restaurant has a different executive chef I would expect some sort of standardization in terms of the tartines. Oh well they were sufficient. The cocktails that we ordered--the special Very Berry Cocktail--was expensive ($14) and tiny, served in a champagne flute. While the main ingredient was prosecco I felt like a cocktail like this would best be served in a cocktail glass. But than again, I'm no bartender. This Holts underwent a renovation a few years back and the rest of the store is of high aesthetic quality. But like any high-end department store or boutique in Toronto I always feel like the service is severely lacking. All of the sales associates--save for one in Louis Vuitton department downstairs--has been so fucking snooty. Why is this such a trend? I KNOW you work on commission, lighten up a little bit and I'll buy more. Crikey. Anyways thats for another review. Bottom line: Holts Cafe is fab to the eye and super chic. The food is 'ok' and the service is unforgettable. But its a nice respite from the crowds of Bloor or the mediocrity of neighbouring food options.\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — holts café', \"It's always a stop here for me either for a quick sandwich or my usual G&T. Always enjoyed the airy, bright, and clean lines either at the bar or in the lounge area. The food is good enough, I never had any issues with it, I only wish the portions were slightly bigger for the prices. Appearance of the food is above average as well as the salt/pepper/sauce dispensers. Service for me has always been efficient, friendly, and attentive. However, being inside Holt's on the 2nd floor with men's clothing on the 1st, do expect the majority of patrons to be women - not that there is anything wrong with that. I along with my male colleague were the only Y-chromes in the room beside the servers at one sitting. (No, I am not - but not that there is anything wrong with that either...)

The food and service is only average. been there 3 times and it has been only average consistently. Wait times for orders are long. had to send back food each time as it was really cold (surprising eh?). it seems they are understaffed leading to longer wait times and delayed food delivery. i really would like them to see stepping it up with the food. not impressive, just average. wine menu is small but GOOD. however given it is freeriding on the HOLTs reputation and the location you get still a different shopping experience.\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — holts café', \"My girlfriend and I had lunch there a few days ago on a Thursday - the mezzanine leveled Cafe - the one where Corbin, celebrity chef works as head chef and is a big reason why I wanted to try the restaurant. The ambiance is lovely - definitely an enchanting and special place to go have lunch. Service is fairly good as well. I have to say, when it came to the food, my main course was a little...disappointing...for appetizers, we started with Canadian baked brie - it was a small round brie that wasn't all that soft for having just been in the oven. It was accompanied with some sort of orange marmalade-like compote and corn chips. All looked ready to go into a miniature museum. We ordered truffled potato chips and each chip came out fairly brown (you'll see in my pics). Overly cooked, in my opinion. Then came my entree - I ordered the osso buco since that's something I don't eat everyday - although the flavors were nice and round, it was incredibly DRY. OMG, was it ever dry. Osso buco should be so tender, moist and juicy...this was just the opposite. I should've ordered the turkey pot pie like my girlfriend. I of course, had to order dessert, and had the sticky toffee pudding - I'm a sucker for it if it's on a menu and that, was a happy ending to this meh of a meal.\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — holts café', \"If you are ever craving a pick and choose, cafeteria style lunch place with fresh food, a stand-alone hot beverage stand and yummy bite-sized cakes, head on over to Holt's Cafe! Located on the lowest level of the Holt Renfrew Centre on Bloor, this cafe is always a great reward once you have been shopping for hours and have worked up an appetite. For main lunch meals, Holt's Cafe offers a WIDE VARIETY of soups, salads and sandwiches. For sandwiches, they have freshly wrapped, pre-made sandwiches and they also offer large panini sandwiches, which are thrown onto the grill right before you take your first bite. Some of the sandwiches I have tried there that were absolutely delicious were the blackened chicken caesar sandwich, the garlic shrimp panini and the avocado tuna on whole wheat. After you are done your main lunch, why not indulge in a hot drink with a little dessert? The cafe has its own stand-alone cappucino stand, with a nice selection of coffee, latte, tea and hot chocolate options. And last but certainly not least, Holt's Cafe has a large amount of different desserts to settle anyone's sweet tooth. The only thing to be warned is that this cafe is PACKED during the working day lunch hour and you may have to shell out more money on certain food items. Overall, Holt's Cafe is just fresh and delicious! I give it an A!\", 'positive']]\n"

I'm getting married and came to learn about Altered Ego at the AZ bridal show. At the show I was attracted to them because they did vintage hairstyles. I was given a $50 gift card at the bridal show. I called today to get info on how the bridal hair works. I was informed that for $50 I could do a trial run. They had a cancellation and were able to get me in today. Upon arriving to the shop I was greeted by two friendly ladies at the front desk. I had to wait a little longer than expected but didn't mind since the atmosphere was inviting. Nicque my stylist came out and escorted me to the joint coffee shop called Solo. Cool concept, you can order a variety of drinks and pay for it when you pay for your salon services. I get into Nicques chair and she's awesome! Easy to talk to and very knowledgeable. We did a vintage updo and it took about 1 1/2 hour. She's very detailed and passionate about her work. I decided to book my bridal party and self for my October wedding. I'm escorted to the front desk and get prepared to pay. I add a 20 tip for Nicque and I'm told the trial will be $80 instead of $50 because it was a detailed style. No biggie I hand over my gift card and the lady at the register said it wasn't working. She goes and speaks to the manager/owner and comes back and tells me unfortunately it was for hair extensions not the service I received. I end up paying $104 for a hair consult. I'm annoyed but pay. I leave sit in my car and look at the gift card. It states: To Bride- from: terri- $50- bride consult. So I go back in. I say that I'm not trying to make a big fuss but I'm left with a bad taste that this gift card is being refused when it does not state that it can only be used for extensions. The owner/manager comes out. She explains to me that this gift card is for another service and she's sorry about the miss communication but I should have let them know prior to my service that I had a gift card and the gift card says Terri but Nicque did my hair. She then tells me how nice my hair is. I am not arguing that I like my hair I'm arguing that the gift card is being refused! She talked down to me and told me she wasn't really sure what I was wanting her to do. I get upset and start to get teary eyed. This is customer service 101 I'm about to bring 4-5 bridesmaids to get salon and she's fighting me for $50! She tells me that she feels bad about the miscommunication. She then tells me that she can meet me halfway and give me $25 off on my wedding day. She states that she thinks that's fair since the gift card is for a completely different service. I just stand there tears falling down my face because I'm so infuriated. She also jokes that if they gave every bride at the expo a $50 gift card they'd not be in business. I wasn't looking for the style to be free. I wanted the gift card to be honored. She should have done the right thing and honored it. I was called after I left and my sweet stylist Nicque offered to honor the gift card on my wedding day. I now however have such a bad taste for this and I absolutely do not want to support the owner of the salon. It sucks because I loved my hair but you never argue with a customer. Also don't hand out fake gift cards that mean nothing! I left in tears furious that I spent that much for a trial and will be expected to pay more on my wedding day.

She specializes in updos, and I wanted to look \"done-up\" but still like me for my elopement. Tawni TOTALLY delivered! The day of the trial, we chatted about my ideas, and I showed her a Pinterest pin board I had created. We went off of one key pin, and Tawni played around with the style. Then she took tons of photos on her iPhone and emailed them to me so I could process the hairstyle at home over the next week. I decided that I wanted even more curls/texture/volume, and that I wanted the fishtail braid a bit longer than in our trial. The morning of my elopement, Tawni opened her shop EARLY for me. My hair was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. The photos I attach will do most of the talking, but I must say that this was a fantastic experience. Tawni was exceptionally professional, as was her assistant (Megan?). They had huge smiles on their faces the entire time my hair was being done; it felt SO good to know that I was in good hands, and that these professionals truly love what they do.

I realize that the stylists on the floor are still learning, and although I have a tremendous amount of patience, I still expect a certain amount of professionalism from my student. I did not have an appointment, but was happy to get in as a walk-in. I was assigned to Mark. I wouldn\\'t have actually known his name since he never told me, and I had just overheard it from others. From the very start, I was never offered any rituals. I explained to him what kind of cut I wanted and he said he understood. His teacher came by, and when she asked if he had given me my ritual, he said that I just wanted the haircut. Okay.... He shampooed me very roughly and many times kept stabbing me in my ears with his fingers then laughed about it. He used many curse words while talking with me, he told me all about the crazy old ladies he has to service, and kept cutting me off anytime he would ask me a question. It was very apparent that he was going to cut my hair how he wanted it, with or without my input. When he was \"finished\" and I expressed to him that it wasn\\'t what I wanted, he continued to tell me how I needed to style it and that if I cut it the way I wanted it, I would look BAD. Excuse me? Thank heavens for the teacher who noticed how uncomfortable I was with the situation. She came over and asked him to shampoo me again and she would show him how to do the cut. I then got the roughest shampoo, yet again, and back to the chair. The teacher was very thorough, and took great consideration for what I wanted. Meanwhile, this Mark character sat next to us complaining that he had been there for 2 hours with me to his buddies. He didn\\'t pay any attention to his teacher who was trying to help him at all. In the end, the teacher (I wish I knew what her name was), did an excellent job with my hair, and I love the cut! I wish I could have her attention-to-detail all the time. Mark decided to take a video of my hair, without even asking me, to post on his instagram, even though he didn\\'t even cut it!!! If I can report the instagram photo, I will.

I don't feel very confident that they know what they're doing. You have a handful of good instructors but the bad outweighs the good by a ton. They really do put customers ahead of you when you are also a customer--a 20K paying customer. They'll make you take customers that are flat out racist and very openly so no matter how they make you uncomfortable with the slurs they say. Not only that, they'll also make you take the extremely homophobic ones and these teachers will not defend you. They claim they are preparing you for the real world when in reality, in the real world you can deny service to such disgusting people. There are teachers that love to abuse their power, send you home early for no real reason and pull you off of your lunch break early just to service a customer because you, as a student, are not their priority. Worst of all, their are higher ups that will mess you up when you apply for a job within the Aveda network. If they don't like you? They'll tell the salon not to hire you.

I almost forgot to mention, they will not teach you about two of the biggest money makers in the beauty industry right now: acrylic nails or extensions.

He did not understand. I needed them to flow into the rest of my hair, almost like a wide upside down U. So my already thin hair was then cut like a \"sex kitten\" as he put it where he glided the scissors down my hair to create a weird layer which will just end up looking like a bunch of flyaway strands.

Not only did they attempt to charge us for services that were not performed (Spa Pedicure when it was really a polish change) the girls who were cashing us out, were clueless. Bless their hearts they were just trying to help, and where was a manager or the owner? Carla was giving someone a pedicure, and did not once offer to help the poor girl who was trying to cash us out that did not know how to operate the systems. When we finally received our bill; which was hand-written on a notepad, we were never offered to include gratuity when they ran our credit cards. So of course, they had to run the card twice. Finally, when we called the salon to follow up on our dissatisfaction, not one apology.

Today I got just a hair cut, which revived my digital perm nicely :) Mr. Kim has long experience doing digi perm both in Japan and in this country, it makes him pick right amount of time etc to make a desired style. I guess I will fly back to AZ again for my next digi perm!\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — Cleo Beauty Salon', \"I lived in South Korea for a year, which is where I got my first Japanese Hair Straightening. My hair has a very thick wave in the back that is hidden by a layer of straight hair. I have tried the Brazilian Blowout on my hair twice and not noticed any change (and it's more expensive). Since being back in the states, I decided that I needed to find somewhere to get my hair straightened since my own hair stylist doesn't do this. I found Cleo Beauty Salon and it was just like being back in Korea. Mr. Kim and his wife, who run the salon, are both Korean and fabulous at what they do. I HIGHLY recommend them!!! My hair looks fantastic, and that's saying a lot! It was well worth the $150 and 3.5 hours. Beware of other salons that want to charge anywhere from $400-900 depending on length and thickness....

I got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo. I have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.) I also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year) Go here get your hair done by an expert.

My stylist who I had went to for years had to start limiting her hours so needless to say we unfortunately had opposite schedules and I needed to find a new salon quickly! Immediately, following the break up my search for a hair queen started. Letting someone else touch my hair was very scary for me... Mostly because I'm blonde and all you other light haired girls out there know that blonde can turn to orange and/ or break off with a quickness if the stylist isn't knowledgeable. So I hopped on social media to see what I could find... after all pictures don't lie and I needed physical proof that my hair wasn't going to fall out! The pictures of her before and after's were on point and exceptionally beautiful. So of course I made an appointment. I HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK SINCE! I should add that I have an autoimmune disease which has caused me to lose a lot of hair so to say that my hair is thinning would be an understatement. Nikki James installs my hair extensions and does my color monthly and I'm grateful to have her in my life. I'm not ashamed to say that my hair was and still is a huge part of my life ... it's a shallow world we live in and I don't see that changing anytime soon.

My first and last time at this salon. I made an appointment to have a touch up done to my roots. Kenya answered the phone when I called and she was very professional answering my questions. That was the only thing professional about my experience with this salon. When I arrived there was no one at the reception to greet meet and I had to wait a little bit until someone turned around to come to the front desk. Keisha came and told me the appointment was with her. She gave me two forms to complete, one of which basically asked you to sign away your life and any liability for any damage the hairdressers may do to your hair. Major red flag! No salon that\\'s worth their reputation would have you sign a disclaimer form absolving their hairdressers from any liability. Clearly they have had issues in the past to have this as a policy. I asked to see the color product she would be using. For some reason after I asked to see the product she would be using she seemed like she did not like me asking this (as she went to get the product showed it to me and then turned around and walked away without a word, which was rude). I had questions regarding the price I was quoted and asked the owner (who seemed nice), but her explanations for a la carte pricing seemed not only outrageous but down right ridiculous, $95 for only a touch up to my roots! ($60 color service, $25 shampoo/conditioner, $10 for color product). She indicated because I was getting only the color (roots touch up mind you) with no styling this would be the cost. Not even in NYC would an upscale salon charge this much. I was on time for my appointment, however I waited for 30 minutes got up and walked out (and she still was blow drying another client\\'s hair). The funny thing is they have a late policy for their customers with a grace period of 15 minutes after which they will start charging by the minute for your tardiness and add that amount to your bill or next service. Certain types of salons have no respect for your time and a simple service that should take an hour or so may end up taking half your day and costing you an arm and a leg. I felt the \"you are going to sit here all afternoon vibe\" and will never allow for that foolishness.

I've been going to Dolce since last year, when I got a gift card from my cousin. I've been back for several massages and facials since then and had a really great experience each time. Were the massages on par with the ones I've gotten at Joya or the Red Door Spa? No, of course not. The price differential is quite large, especially when you take into consideration that I never go to Dolce without using some kind of Facebook Hook Up, Groupon or Hunies to get at least half off the service. For the price that I'm paying, these services are awesome! You get the luxury atmosphere of the spa and a relaxing day without having to empty out everything in your wallet. While the services aren't on par with the ones I've received at places that have $200 massages, they also aren't charging $200 - hence my satisfaction. I love the 90-minute Swedish and Combination massages and my favorite masseuse is Sherrie, who's always giving me tips on how to reduce the stress on my back and arms from my desk job. I've never had a problem with the desk staff, as some other reviewers have noted below. It seems that a lot of the unhappy reviews are associated with salon services, which I've never tried, so they could be 100% valid. In terms of massages and facials, I think Dolce is a great place - just make sure to be on the look out for their Facebook deals to get a good price!\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — Dolce Salon & Spa', 'I got great good highlights from Zach at Arrowhead, when I was desperate for some decent color one sunny day.... I would 100% say you can trust him with your color, he does a very precise job with the foils and the natural blend appearance when its done is great... even as he uses several colors is just amazing how pretty it looks. He blends his toners and blends his colors so he really picks accurate and pretty shades. I also had dyed my hair myself so it was a bit orange and uneven colored in places and he actually fixed it. The next time I go and I will let him know I want to get a little more eclectic and Im sure it will look great. Ive had my hair colored and highlighted all over the world at various salons so I can tell he knows what he is doing and he is polite also. I also go to the Borgata location alot....I just had highlights from a Level 2 Alyssa..she was awesome and I would recommend because you save with a Level 2 and you will get GREAT quality color from her and I got a beautiful style blow out from her assistant Roxy who had adorable bright red hair. They will be my new GO TO girls!!! I again went to Borgata and had the most beautiful color done with Annette, Level 2 and she trimmed my bangs so perfect, long and I can swoop them prettily to the side..I have past shoulder length hair, long layers and Annette gave me the best blowout after the color.

First, I had my hair cut and colored here one time and the girl seemed mad my appointment was at 8 and then gave me the most bland hair I\\'ve ever had. I asked for the fringe bangs and she definitely gave me the same side swipe everyone else there had and my color was totally flat. Okay, so I decided to give them a second chance and scheduled a pedicure, manicure, cut and color for both my mom and myself. Huge mistake. I broke my collarbone three days before the appointment and told them that when I arrived. This way, they would not turn on the chair and be sensitive to how they moved me when doing services. My $85 pedicure did not include paraffin wax, nor clipping/shaping of my nails or any sort of pumice. The girl spent her time talking loudly to another girl at a nearby station and managed to smudge both my mom and I\\'s nails. Oh, and turned the chair on to \"massage\" my hugely swollen, bruised, broken colloarbone. Whatever, just get me to the hair station. I told the girl, I want to go lighter with blonde highlights. My mom said lowlights and mostly, just cover the gray! I came out with jet black hair and my mother ended up with gray temples. My cut came out with side swept bangs and razored ends, which are TERRIBLE for thin, fine hair. My mom had some sort of long, bowl cut...horrible. They were both rude and basically wanted us out of their chairs. At the cash register, they brought us baskets full of product they had supposedly used. Um, no, they didn\\'t use anything but shampoo and conditioner! We paid, my mom left a huge tip and we grimaced our way out. I went to another salon to fix my hair and my AWESOME stylist there called the salon to see what they had used so she could fix it. I could actually hear the manager screaming into the phone, saying they had no records of what had been done. That the stylist had \"forgot\" to write it down. Then proceded to call me a liar and demand that I go back to have it fixed by the same stylist. Uh, no thanks, chief. DO NOT USE THIS SALON EVER.

A woman gave me some information on the facials I was interested in, and then suggested a peel and that I should come in to have a test patch done. I won\\'t go into detail because it\\'s been said, but the customer service is just AWFUL. I have never felt so unwelcome. I wonder if the only time these girls are nice is if their friends come in for a service. There were around five of them just standing around talking. I don\\'t know where the unemployment rates are coming from because this Dolce has hired at least %10 of Arizona. After I was taken upstairs through a literal maze I was not asked any questions about my skin, I had to tell her what I was not happy with and what results I was looking for. She barely said anything except how crappy drugstore face washes are because they don\\'t balance your PH and how I should buy face wash from Dolce, (no thanks I get all my stuff from Lush and it\\'s fantastic, natural, and cheap.) Then she told me to lay down and proceeded to slop some goop on my neck, without even cleaning the area first. I don\\'t wear make up on my neck but it does get hot outside so there must have been dust/sweat. She told me to make my appointment before I left, but if I had a reaction to the chemical I could call and change the service.

She immediately said, \"It\\'s $49.99.\" I said, \"I have a coupon for $34.99. Besides, the banner outside said $39.99.\" She said, \"That price is for short hair. Long hair extra.\" My hair length is only a little below my earlobes! I said, \"Mine is short! This is way above shoulder. I thought shoulder length and below is considered long hair.\" She said, \"Did you go to beauty school?\" I probably should have left with that first clue.

I agreed as I was already there. My hair dye task is an easy, all over black color. Other places had asked me what type of black (brownish, reddish, blue, straight, etc.) and sometimes show samples of colors but she never bothered and just went ahead with a black color. Shortly after she started with me, a customer walked in. She left me and went to ask that lady what\\'s needed and told that lady, \"I will be ready for you in 20 minutes once I am done with her.\" I had never had hair coloring for only 20 minutes. Surely, it was more than 20 minutes when she left me for that lady, but she did not finish half of my hair. She spent 40 minutes with the lady before she came back to finish coloring my hair. I don\\'t believe that\\'s the correct way to do it as the whole head has two different coloring time. Along the side of my face was painted a thick layer of black color during this time. Since she didn\\'t use any hair clips but just held different bunches by hand (with gloves), some piles dropped on my face and left black marks right on the face. Finally she washed my hair. I was hoping all the black ink would be gone. But no, it was lighter but obvious along the side of my face and some still on the face. Knowing how the front looked like, I asked to see my back with a hand-held mirror and there was the same black ink on my neck. I asked her to please clean the color, she again used soft voice to refuse, \"I can\\'t get rid it. I can\\'t. I can\\'t.\" I thought I heard it wrong. When I asked again, she again said, \"I can\\'t do it. I can\\'t. I can\\'t.\" Even her co-worker heard her soft argument, and told her, \"Use the color remover.\" which was a bottle right on the counter. She reluctantly used it a little bit, but insisted that the ink would go away by itself later, not now. I also softly inquired, \"How would the color go away by itself if I don\\'t do anything?\" She insisted, \"It just would.\" I didn\\'t ask anymore. I paid her $45 cash, she didn\\'t bother giving change. Upon my request for a receipt, she gave me one that noted for the additional charge, \"Extra Length Color $10\". Anyone in this world would not call my way above shoulder hair \"long\", let alone \"extra length\". My hair was still dripping wet when I left the store because when I asked her if it could be blow dried a little more, she said it\\'s an extra $10.

I\\'m officially in that camp now. Went on a Wednesday evening around 6:00 pm. Other than about 7 folks milling around the bar area, there was only one other couple in the whole dining area. I was very shocked - for prime time dining hour. That to me is communicating a message - you who management, you may want to note this. I understand it was Wednesday and it would not be overly crowded, but I expected others besides just one lone couple - at the prime dinner hour. I did note from their beer list that they are about $1- $2 higher on their drafts than most everyone else. I had the Flipside pale ale collaboration with Lucky Owl from Chagrin Falls. Usually when it is your \"house brew\", you price it less than all the others. No so here - $6 which was the same as some others. I had the special - chicken banh mi - $12. Considering they were touting all the different items on the sandwich - slaw, cilantro, aioli, jalepenos, etc. - I was expecting a flavor burst. No such luck. I\\'d say the sandwich was relatively tasteless. For $12, which is a steep price for a chicken sandwich, it better sing and be very good. This was quite far from it. My dining companions had the \"Say Cheese\" burgers which are essentially $8.50 burgers. No complaints although my wife (who also was a big fan of Flipside) did comment that she recently had a few burgers elsewhere that were better than this. Ordered a plain fry and an order of onion rings. Oddly, these came out before the meal and the girl that brought them out said that our meals are \"right behind this\". Well, they must have got lost because they probably came out, what seemed to be, 10 min. later. Fries and rings were good. I fell in love with the fries previously, but I could say, not with this batch. Note: No where during this time did the waitress come by to check and give us assurance the our meals would be coming.

This was my first time at Grateful Head and I left very happy, my hair looked beautiful. I had a cut with Earl, and colour with Dana. Lysa was very helpful and answered all my questions via email, prior to the visit. What I was trying to achieve with my hair: last November I put a semi-permanent medium brown/auburn, it mostly washed out over the winter, but the stubborn copper stayed and it didn't suit my complexion at all. My natural colour is a dark golden blonde with an ash base. I really wanted my natural colour back, with a few higlights for a bit of brightness, without the damage, as I'm trying to grow out my hair a little longer. Dana really understood what I was looking for, and we did very natural 'sun-kissed' babylights and toner (few minutes at the sink). Dana was keeping an eye on the highlights as my hair is very fine, and also noticed that my colour lifted very quickly, which was awesome, so we didn't need to leave in it longer than necessary=no damage. The baby lights looked so nice that I decided to add on a tiny bit more a week later. It was perfect. And I'm glad we took it slowly as I wanted to make sure it was what I wanted. The cut that Earl did was stunning, he's amazing, it suits my face shape perfectly, and since I let my hair air dry, the cut works with that. I keep my hair mostly all the same length (for more volume), and with this cut, it looks even fuller and brings out the natural wave, which I love. I'm super happy I went to Grateful Head.\", 'positive'], ['Yalp — Grateful Head', 'I have had my hair bleached a couple times, once before recently dying it mint.

Using scissors only (as I requested) she managed to cut my hair on the side to almost the skin... on one side. The other side was trimmed actually not too bad save for the raised patches here and there. She barely touched the top so the end result was a very 90\\'s looking hairstyle. When she showed me the back, my hairline at the bottom looked totally crooked so I figured it must be me seeing it wrong. She blow dried it and styled it a bit and in the lights and mirrors there, it looked okay. When I got home and showered, upon further investigation, there was no fade from the side of my head to the top, just clumps and indeed the bottom line at the back was on an angle. I basically had a crooked bad bowl cut. The part that really gets me is that this woman is 22 years old. How does that qualify her to be a senior stylist? I guess the \"new talent\" come in to see their clients during recess! They really have a lot of nerve charging the money they do for such inexperienced stylists who clearly have no idea what they are doing. I guess she earns that for dressing up like Betti Page?

I should say that while waiting 2 people complain about another hairdresser on duty. The culture is very quick clip and go. Still. I wait. Finally my turn. She greets me and I sit but I warn her about my length and I make her fully aware that I wanted to chop a good amount off. No biggie, right? She begins by almost discouraging me about the amount I wanted to cut. Asking me \"Are you sure?\" at least 4 times. Whatever. I\\'m already on the chair. She starts to brush through my hair and my head was snapping back so hard and I was clearly in discomfort but she keeps brushing through until I ask her if I can brush through my own hair. Not once did she apologize or seem to acknowledge the discomfort. As she begins to measure out the length and confirm with me I ask her if it was possible to make a first cut long enough and then we can go from there if I wanted to go shorter. She claimed that she couldn\\'t do that because then she\\'d have to charge me two haircuts. OK?!... We go back and forth and I settle with \"bra strap\" length. I figured that\\'s long enough to get used to shorter hair than what I\\'ve had for 5 years now. She starts chopping off and I remind her that I didn\\'t want a blunt straight cut and she says \"then how do you want it?\" At this point I\\'m ready to get out of the chair except she\\'s already chopped off half of the hair. I asked her to do what they call a \"notch cut\" which makes the hair look more choppy than straight cut. As she\\'s cutting my hair, they get a new customer and another hair dresser checks them in and I can hear the customer being told that the wait would be 15 minutes. My hairdresser butts in and says \"more like 30, I\\'ve got a lot of hair here\" not in a joking way, not in a light hearted way but in a tone of annoyance. Anyway.

Got a cut by Sarah on 5/5/18 and after I went home, washed and waited for it to dry (I don\\'t blow dry, per Sarah my hair doesn\\'t blow dry correctly because I cut it at one length. Yeah right!) and noticed that one side was significantly longer than the other side (at least 1\"). I went in to have her fix it (hey, things happen, right). She actually was arguing with me about whether it was uneven or not, pulling some strands from the very front to the center of my chin as empirical proof of this. I pointed out the uneven portion was behind my ear so that test wouldn\\'t work. I told her to look that one side is touching the top of the shoulder and the other is about 1 inch above the shoulder. THAT is proof of the unevenness of the cut. She finally agreed to fix it and started. Didn\\'t take very long. Then she started to cut the short side shorter I had to stop her. Finally leaving with a so-so cut and a bad feeling overall. On 5/8/18 I called to an appointment on 5/12/18 for my mom to get a cut and perm from Gloria at the shop. I was told \"let me check with Gloria when she comes in at 9 and if the appointment is ok with her you WON\\'T hear back from us.\" I didn\\'t hear back so on the 12th I got mom (who is physically handicapped and on oxygen 24/7) and loaded her into the car and arrived for the appointment at about 10 till our time. I was told that Gloria knew absolutely nothing about our appointment even though is was clearly written in the book (which the shop admitted). Gloria had 2 other\\'s ahead of mom (walk ins who should have been assigned to another stylists at this time) and the wait would be 1 hour! Now a perm and cut usually takes about 3 hours and mom\\'s portable O2 tank had enough in it to ensure we had time for the perm and the return home not an additional 1 hour wait!

I was scolded by the colourist who said my hair looked like the picture when it most certainly did not. After the owner tried to fix it, it arguably looked worse. -Balayage skill level is not high amongst this particular colourist and the owner. -Sinead the cheery Irish girl did a great job on the cut. -Spent an additional $300 (tip included) at another salon in Guelph, Ontario to get the colour fixed Full story: I had booked an appointment with Ryan because he did my friend\\'s hair (note she is a blonde) and I didn\\'t have a colorist in Toronto. This was the first time I had ever dyed my hair at a salon and before I could get the balayage that I wanted done, I would have to pay $80 plus tip to release some previous colour from my hair. After getting the \"cocktail\" (which is what he called it) done, he noted that the previous colour lifted so well he probably didn\\'t have to do that Steph. It would have been better if he hadn\\'t told me because now I\\'m out $100(cocktail plus the tip).but I know there is no way to be able to tell that in advance and it is better to be safe than sorry. The day of my balayage appointment he tried a method which I can say to this day I have never seen done in order to achieve a balayage. It was horrible: I was in the chair for 5.5 hours JUST for foils. He would section off the smallest little pieces on my head, which I didn\\'t say anything about because I wanted to see if maybe he knew a better way than I had seen before. He mentioned that himself and the owner taught balayage classes at the salon which I don\\'t know how that is possible because of the pictures I will be showing later. Because it took so long and I had to get to work, I had to leave the salon with wet hair and I had to style it myself. I got home and did just that and was horrified that I had over 150 thin highlights in a very weird ashy blonde (almost grey looking) colour. My coworkers tried to feign their love for my new do but eventually when I got it fixed by someone else they told me how bad it was. I went back the next day and when I told Ryan I didn\\'t like it he came off SUPER defensive and told me that that was exactly what I had asked for and that the colour in the picture was the same as my hair and that balayage looks better curled and my hair was not curled so I didn\\'t know that it looked exactly like the picture. His aggressive tone and the fact that I had IN TOTAL spent $550 (cocktail, tip, \"balayage\", tip, olaplex, toner) made me cry. I had spend so much money on hair I really DID NOT LIKE. the owner was kind enough to call him away from me and asked to fix my hair for me. I just believe the skill level between Ryan and Rebecca aren\\'t there for balayage. She tried to fix it and after the over processed mess that I had in my hair before she got to it, another process probably wasn\\'t the answer. It was uneven (she started with the left side of my head, then right, then back. When most colourists starts bottom to top.) I had noticed my left side was much blonder than my right and much more processed. In the end, I had to go to my hairstylist in Guelph, ON to get the whole mess fixed. She is great, and did it in one hour foils (which was amazing considering it took 5.5 hours to begin my hair tragedy). It was a fraction of the cost, ONLY $300.

I have used Yelp as a fairly credible resource in the past and this place had great reviews. New to the area, I came to Ish to get my hair cut and styled. The person I originally scheduled with had to cancel, but I went in and got a cut and style with another stylist. Shortly after, I returned to the salon because I was not satisfied with how the layers were falling in my long hair. I wanted them blended more. When I called to schedule the corrective cut, I was told that the owner could fit me in later in the week. I was very grateful. However, when I arrived, I was not in the books, but he did squeeze me in before his next appointment. We went over what needed amending and I felt heard. He was very friendly (so was the rest of the staff) and the atmosphere was pleasant. His next client came, however, and I could feel the urgency to finish with my cut/style. From here, I am honestly not sure what happened, but I left the salon with what is the worst haircut since my childhood. Though the layers were now blended in the back, a far worse problem was created. My front left side was SEVERELY uneven (see pictures). It's as if the scissors slipped and a huge chunk was cut out. When I saw my hair before I left, I was in shock and hopeful that it was just a wave/curl that was making things so uneven. I was extremely upset and could not bring myself to go in for a THIRD time. Ultimately, I had to find another salon (where I will go from now on) and pay full price for yet another haircut and style. Much to my despair, I have lost at least three and a half inches total off my length and paid for two haircuts.

Kiki did not do my hair I was okay with that she had the two sisters do it I was very happy. I'm very picky on my hair ( I know hair I'm from the hair capital yes Detroit) LOL . I was told 180.00 for my micros that was fine I even gave a tip at this appointment. I came back in January 2015 to get box braids and I wanted a big bun I asked Kiki could she do it because I liked the wy she did the other persons hair she said yes. When I got there she parted my hair and left I asked where she was going and she said she was moving today I said okay but you said you were going to do my hair... Okay so I moved pass that... Then the ladies kept going back and forth about how much to charge me Kiki told me 180.00 again and the other lady was saying 200.00 they were trying to hustle me so I said okay I'm not going over 200.00 and that was their tip since they tried to play me and pissed me off because they didn't even put my hiar in a bun talking about it was going to hurt I said this is what I came for I know it's going to be tender... Okay so I left there unhappy plus those braids kept me having a headache because I don't know how to put it up in a bun.... So my final and last appointment was last week Friday I called a couple of days and asked Kiki again if she could do my hair and she said she would call me back when she got home to look in her book... She never called me back so I gave her the benefit and called back thinking maybe she got busy or lost my number in the mist. I called back and the lady said I could come in with Kiki I get there and Kiki has another client in her chair... I said okay maybe it's not meant for Kiki to do my hair.... But I saw the lady who usually does it sitting down and two other women I figured she would do it again instead she had a other lady like in her mid 50's (and who was all in my phone) start my hair I explained that I DIDNT want my edges braided or the back close to my neck for these are the areas that pull and fall out and would make me bald.... I don't do bald... Okay after telling her several times Kiki tells her and she starts speaking in their language which I felt they were talking about me... Kiki showed me how unprofessional she really is she kept rolling her eyes. I don't know if it's their culture but she has lost a customer. Also just know if you have two braiders if someone else comes in your going to lose a braider... It took this older lady 8 hours I had to leave my back was killing me so bad. And when I get some my edges are all braided I paid and walked out. Kiki yelled BYE to me ...not thank you ...do you like your hair nothing....

The location is incredibly easy to get to, being in the heart of Yorkville, and the best part of it is that it comes without ego or pretension. The space is warm and the people are easygoing and very inviting, not Snobville at all...I met with Mel, who I was immediately comfortable with, she was like a friend, who just happens to have a top shelf brain and vision for really great hair. She understands the actual chemistry and science behind color and the true art and lines of a cut. I am always impressed by her knowledge and eye. I appreciate the feeling you get from a person who is obviously educated and very good at what they do, as that can be hard to find. When I started seeing her, my hair was just above my shoulders, curly and full. I wanted to grow it out. My colour was dark brown, and I needed my roots done. The colour adjustment she did was perfect, she took the edge off the brown/black harshness that happens when you need touch ups on dark hair, and the cut was exact. As my hair grew out, Mel shaped it and cut it, so that it always looked longer as it was growing, and I guess the proper word for it would be, balanced. I never felt like it was getting top heavy or winging out. She explained to me how my hair had been cut in the past and how she is going to cut it this time to create the look I\\'m going for.

I am very particular about that. For the last several years, my hair has been dark brown, and whenever I have tried to lighten it in the past in anyway, it has always looked brassy or unhealthy, but I always wanted it a bit lighter. So now, my hair has grown out to long past my shoulders, and I have lightened it a few shades, dabbled in the ombre look and have perfectly toned highlights throughout, and I love it. The colour is perfection, my skin tone is balanced, and my cut is exactly how I envisioned it to be as it grew out.

I was offered tea or coffee while my hair was being coloured. The end result was the highlights having roots of 5-7mm on the day they were done, looking like they were done over a month ago. Overall I'm pretty disappointed with the quality of customer service, communication, and the final product. This is the first time I've left a salon thinking that my hair looked better beforehand. I wouldn't return, even for a discounted deal.\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — Lid Salon', 'After letting it grow for months and months with nary a cut, my hair had become something of an wild, untamed mess. No longer wishing to risk being mistaken for Medusa, I decided that something had to be done. Always on the lookout for great salons and ways to pinch pennies, I ended up snagging a Fabfind deal for a wash, blowdry and cut for $35 at Lid back in May. I probably called 2 or 3 times and left a message that wasn\\'t returned before I was able to make an appointment, which was slightly annoying. Their website states that their hours are 8am to \"closing\", whenever that is, but it seemed like any time I tried to call after 5pm nobody picked up so it\\'s probably best to call in the morning or early afternoon. Apparently Lid is a very busy salon, and with the success of their Fabfind deal I actually couldn\\'t get a Saturday appointment for several weeks. When the day finally arrived for my 3pm appointment with Angela, I showed up about 10 minutes early and she was able to get started with me right away. The salon itself is located on the second floor of a little building in Yorkville, up a narrow flight of stairs. The decor is pretty simplistic with little to mention in terms of ambiance, and I think the building used to be a house because the salon is divided into all these different rooms. They also do esthetics here so there are nail stations and a reflexology bed and the like. My appointment started off with a brief chat about what I wanted to do with my hair (just a trim with some layers) and then Angela proceeded to wash my hair and give me an invigorating scalp massage. I believe this salon uses Kevin Murphy products for the most part, which I love. Angela wasn\\'t much of a chatter, which was fine by me, although I do wish that she had elicited some more feedback from me such as how I would prefer to have my hair styled after the cut. Overall, I\\'m satisfied with my haircut and I have no major complaints. However, the regular price for a cut, blowdry and style here ranges from $75 - $110. At that price point, I would expect a lot more than what I received. From my experience, I definitely wouldn\\'t return here if I were paying full price, and I probably wouldn\\'t come back even with a Fabfind offer. I\\'ve paid much less than $110 at salons that return your messages, give you reminder phone calls, offer you complimentary beverages and hand massages, and leave you feeling \"fabulous\" and not just \"fine\".', 'negative'], ['Yalp — Life Hair Studio', \"It is interesting how the reviews of this salon are either really bad (one star) or excellent (almost 5 stars).

Finally, when she carelessly lopped off my bangs far above the eyebrows, I lost it.

I should have walked down to queen street and paid a crackhead 5 dollars to cut my hair with a pair of hedge clippers. Guaranteed better results.

I also requested my hair to be styled and straightened, not cut. Once the guy finished dying my hair, he blowed dry \"straight\" my hair. I asked if he could use a flat iron to make it completely straight, not curved inwards, where he then insisted that flat irons were bad for the hair and he did not want to use it on my head. I understand this but as a paying customer, I like having my hair a certain way. He still did not flat iron my hair nor take the colour off my face. He said he had another customer and could not take the extra time and told me that the colour would come off in a few days. I paid the price (180$), and will never be a repeat customer, for this price i expected a much better service, and quality.

I can't stop touching it and playing with it...it both looks and feels really good even after all that processing was done to it. Whatever Alicia did was magic! I made an appointment for a hair cut and a balayage through the online booking system. Most appointments appeared to be booked up about 2 weeks in advance of when I was looking but luckily Alicia had an opening. I was appreciative that the studio does some due diligence on new clients beforehand which was a few questions about hair history and current hair photos. They do this to make sure your hair isn't so over processed that any other work will destroy it, instead of turning you away at the studio. I had some correspondence with the studio to make sure I had booked the correct services for my hair. All of the communications were fast and helpful since I wasn't sure exactly what I needed. As for the actual experience, it couldn't have gone better. Alicia is listed as a new talent but rest assured she's only newer to the studio (as opposed to new at hair) and experienced. I had a goal in mind and showed her a picture of it and she let me know that it would probably take a couple of sessions to get my hair as light as I wanted. No problem, I'd rather take it slow than lose my hair to impatience. We started off with the haircut which I absolutely love. I was getting a lot of length off and there were no problems with the cut; no extra inches off or timidness about cutting it all off. Then came the colouring which was about a 6 hour ordeal. This is where Alicia's amazing personality really came in to play because she's really chill and easy to talk to which made the marathon go by a little faster. We had some help during the process with the salon assistants and Lisa also came by to check on how everything was going. It was really awesome to see that everyone was willing to pitch in and help you get your perfect hair. I'd definitely recommend this studio to anyone that's looking for Instagram-worthy hair. One other bonus is that this studio is surrounded between a Starbucks, a chocolatier, AND a macaron shop so you can set up for a perfect day of pampering.

I've gotten numerous recommendations from friends/colleagues but nothing caught my eye until one of my colleagues recommended Lisa Dinh. I stalked their instagram and was in love with what I saw. I didn't have a preference for a stylist because they all seemed AMAZING. I booked the soonest weekend appointment I could get with any stylist. When the morning of the appointment came, I got a call saying my stylist was sick, however, Lisa and her assistant Rian would be available to do my hair. My hair was previously dyed brown and has since grown out a lot and it turned brassy/super orange. They both did an outstanding job and rescued my hair! Rian began with a consultation and assessed my hair. They really listen to what you want and will tell you what's achievable. I told them I wasn't comfortable going too light. I'm pretty low maintenance/lazy and I wanted something natural but with dimension. They did a colour correction, toned it, added lowlights, blowdried and styled it in 4 hours (it honestly went by so fast!) My total before tip was $339. Although Lisa did my hair with Rian, my appointment was with a new talent stylist and Lisa honoured that pricing. I was so happy with how my hair turned out and when Lisa showed me a picture of my hair, I was shocked and couldn't believe that it was really my hair! I've gotten so many compliments; I'm addicted and I can't wait to return in a couple of months and go even lighter! Atmosphere: It's sleek, modern, and busy in there. You can tell that the girls are like one big family. They joke, they laugh, and they have fun while maintaining professionalism and quality work. Lisa, as the owner, is also very hands on with the work - wiping down mirrors, sweeping hair etc. She's always checking up on the girls and clients just to see if everything is going well.

I came across them on instagram and have been on the look out for a hair salon that was able to achieve an extremely cool toned ashy blonde/ almost silver tone on dark black hair which is often difficult to achieve. Every hair colourist who I found that I took a liking to their work was from California- That is until I came across Lisa's page. I looked at all of the staff members' pages and decided Olivia was my choice. I booked 4 months in advance and finally got my hair done earlier this week. I cannot be happier with my hair colour.

She spent 5 hours on my hair and was well attended to. If you're concerned about the price, all I can say is, there is a reason why you don't often see hair colour as beautifully done as this on the streets everyday. The way Olivia blended/ achieved the blonde and super ashy silver tones in my hair just from one session pleasantly surprised me. I showed Olivia a picture of the colour I wanted and she explained to me that I'd have to do a few more sessions to achieve it, which I understand. Although the balayage ombré I ended up with looks different from the picture I showed her- I'm 100% okay with that because they're artists and one artist will put their own unique spin on their piece of work, which is what she did and it looks fantastic. I also knew I wanted to purchase the right products to properly maintain the colour and expressed to Olivia that I was looking for products. She made sure to write down the products she'd recommends and didn't push to sell my the products in the studio which I appreciate. I ended up getting one of their purple shampoos and going to out and purchasing the recommended shampoo and conditioner that I can use on a more frequent basis. Before I went to my first appointment, I'd already booked my second because of the long wait list, which is okay with me.

The Good: First of all, I loved how friendly the salon was. Everyone was welcoming. Samantha was also very nice and easy to talk to. Samantha did an AMAZING job with colouring my hair. I told her what I wanted (natural with some lighter brown highlights/balayage) and she did exactly that. She kept checking in to make sure that the lightening was going okay. She never complained about how much hair I had (I have lots of thick hair) and was very pleasant throughout the whole process. I have received many compliments when my hair is curled. The not as good: I wasn't as happy with my hair cut. I didn't realize how odd my hair looked from the back when it's straight till a week after my hair cut (when someone made a comment about it). I specifically requested for a hair cut that looked good straight or curled and right now, it only looks curled. Since she is the professional, I completely trusted her when she said it would look better more blunt and not thinned out so that I have more volume. And for most people that's probably true. But because I have straight and thick hair, my hair looks quite messy with the blunt cut. I will post a photo from the back. Also, my bangs are brighter in colour than the rest of my hair... I told her near the beginning that I like side swept bangs and also that I like having lighter colours to frame my face. I guess I should have clarified that that does noT include my bangs...

When I got there, no one was around to greet me. After awkwardly sitting down, I waited for Olivia to come - I showed pictures of subtle balayage but she said I should go for something lighter. I insisted I did not want to look like the typical brunette blonde - anyway, at the end it looked like that. I still trusted her because she is the professional here. During the process, I felt she wasn't friendly and brushed my hair very roughly - to the point where my hair was elasticky and breaking. We all know that our hair's at its weakest when it's 1) wet and 2) after chemical processing. Lisa helped brushed out my hair as well but she was definitely gentle and patient with my hair, taking her time and not yanking out knots. In the end, I wasn't happy with my colour, so Olivia ended up putting a toner on for a bit and I left with happier colour but with broken hair. I know that this salon has a policy where you can go back and have them fix anything you want free if you're not satisfied, but I didn't want to risk getting my hair in even worse shape. Oops I almost forgot to mention, my hair went back to being light after 2 weeks...... I did not brush my hair for atleast 2 weeks, especially when it was wet, any slight tugging would rip the strands. To be honest, i was really scared. I had to do hair treatments every day for the next 3 weeks and lots of olaplex at another salon, and had them correct my hair colour as well. I regret to write this review and I know some ppl have their bad days at their job, but if you're passionate about your work, your mood shouldn't get in the way of quality work. I warned many friends from coming here thereafter and suggested the other salon which actually fixed my hair. ------------------ Thanks Lisa, I appreciate your feedback. During the consultation, I was asked when it was the last time I had my hair coloured. I get annual straightening perm done followed by hair colouring and highlights for many many years now. I did not mention the perm because I was i) not asked about it, and ii) it did not cross my mind that it would be an issue. Yes, it was a miscommunication, and I know these things can happen.

They have an old meets new feel to the place without making you feel at home. What I got out of this place is a new idea that really works for people like me. By this I mean that I like the whole grooming part of getting a haircut which I\\'m not afraid to admit as long as it\\'s from a place like Mankind. Now, I\\'m not quite sure if I\\'ll use all their services, yet they offer a few extras that I enjoy such as a hand/wax treatment while you get your cut and a hot towel that is incredibly relaxing. Another nice touch is the drink they offer you on the way in. They have a 65\" screen TV which is hooked up to a Playstation which makes this place so chill. They also offer things like men\\'s manicures \"The Man Hands\", massage table \"Feeling Kneady\" in a quiet room area but the coolest thing that I haven\\'t seen since my grandfather used to take me to his barber is their straight blade shave. this place doesn\\'t smell like chemical products nor is there a thousand people running around chaotically. One feature that I thought was great was the TV\\'s at every grooming station so that you don\\'t miss the game or whatever...

I didn't realize that she was not going to preserve the layering in my hair and basically chopped off 2 inches and made my hair end very bluntly all at the same length. I didn't realize this until later when the curls she gave me started to loosen. When I called her about it she was gracious and offered to add in those layers for me at no extra charge (+tip of course!). She squeezed me in on a busy Saturday and even though she had to reschedule me at the last minute I still appreciated her working me in as a free appointment.

Otherwise it may not turn out the way you want (not that it was Karinna's fault or anything-I never said anything about the layers so that's on me. I just asssumed she would keep them). But if you aren't happy with your hair she'll definitely make it right. As a reference, I paid $170 + tip for my bleaching and coloring.

The Salon is small, but clean and the receptionist was very friendly. She correctly guessed who I was based on the time I walked in and the appointment that was scheduled which was nice, she let me know that she would inform my stylist that I was there. I sat myself down and not another word was said to me or another glance given for the next 20 minutes. I wasn't too upset about the wait time because I did arrive 15 minutes early. However, no offer of a magazine to read, water to drink, or coffee, etc. Eye contact seemed to be avoided at all costs. To be fair, there was some self serve coffee set out if I had wanted any, but I didn't. It was cool to me because I'm not much for eating and drinking while I get my hair done to begin with, but if you're going to try to be competitive with other high end salons in the valley (of which there are many), you're going to have to do far better than some 'serve yourself' gas station style coffee setup on the side. After 20 minutes of waiting my stylist came out and so it began. I felt that I was very clear in the style of cut that I wanted, even going so far as to show pictures of what I wanted, and then we discussed color. Then.. the cutting started.... Now, I went in for a pretty classic cut, something in the style of an A-Line, where I could tuck it to the side if I wanted. This should be a simple haircut for even the novice stylist. I don't know why I bothered to say anything in the first place - it was a cut that I could have gotten at Great Clips, if even that good. While all of this was going on, the entire staff seemed disinterested in being there at best. Most of them were doing 1 of 3 things, 1) Checking their cellphones and texting constantly, 2) Bitching about the atmosphere and the music there - I guess station changes are not allowed? or 3) Cleaning / sweeping or doing menial chores with scowls on their faces. Biting my tongue since it was already far too late in the process, I hoped that the whole bad cut would be redeemed in the color / styling portion of the experience. What I got for the color was even more shockingly bad than the damned cut itself! As many of you know, hair dye tends to DYE the skin it touches. By the time the stylist was finished slopping the dye on (and I don't use that term lightly), I had dye all over my forehead, ears, neck and face. Even worse, she didn't offer to wipe it off of my face at ALL!!! I shit you not - she dabbed around my ears, scrubbed around the hairline, and didn't even touch the dye that she smeared across my face that was visibly darkening!! Even then she still didn't wipe it off but tried to brush the side of the hair over it to cover it! To add insult to injury, the entire botched job ended up costing me FAR more for JUST the cut and color / highlights than what I have paid at previous high end salons. No product after that - why bother? I have gone to Dolce Salon, Mane Attraction Salon and various other Salons across the Valley over the years. Any ONE of them had far superior service, far superior staff, far superior environment, and far superior quality - PLUS I could get product to go with the new cut and style for less than what I paid to walk out of here for. Long story short? I walked out looking Shemp from the 3 Stooges with a black eye thanks to the dye smeared across my face. I did manage to scrub the dye off at home. My boyfriend ended up trimming the back in places she had 'missed'. Yeah.. awesome. And while the stylist was nice and friendly, I will not be going back there.

I ended up with a weird mixture of chunky and stringy highlights that didn\\'t quite touch my roots. It looked awful. Absolutely not an ombre by ANY means. But, since I\\'d never had my hair colored before, it took me a day or so to realize how botched it was. I called them and explained that I don\\'t think I got what I asked for, and if I could come back in to have them fix it. The receptionist was really polite and sweet and told me to come back in and they would take care of it. Round two, I should not have trusted Danielle again. She put a color lifter on my ends and called it a day, only after charging me for the product and a crooked trim. It looked even worse. Again, I should have realized before I left, but I felt like I was under a lot of pressure. Danielle and Kelly consulted with each other within my earshot about how they -did- give me an ombre, and just in general made me feel like I was being a huge problem for them. I made sure to be extra polite but it didn\\'t seem to matter. I ended up going to Nadia Salon on Walnut Street where Lee saved my hair. However, the damage that Danielle did was so extensive that he had to cut off a bunch of dead ends, fix the crooked trim, and apply color to my roots to cover the highlights--- all of these things could have been avoided if only Danielle had actually given me the hair I asked for, instead of defending herself and using me as a guinea pig for this so called \"new technique\". I went back to Mint/Dante and (politely, again) asked to speak with the owner. She was with a client, so I asked her if she would have time to speak with me today at all. She flat out said \"nope\"! I understand that she was busy but that was so rude. It\\'s a small place (same 4 stylists each time I was there) so I am positive she recognized me. Danielle was at the front desk and I told her that even though I came back to have my hair fixed, I am still not happy with it, and would like to know if I could get some sort of refund. She gave me Kelly\\'s card and said I could email her. (I brought my boyfriend with me so that I wouldn\\'t back down) He politely said that I have already spent a lot of time/money here, and I don\\'t want emailing her to be another big ordeal. We were there to clear the air and talk with the owner before writing a bad review somewhere. Danielle said Kelly would be able to talk with us in 15 minutes. We waited 25 minutes while listening to them talk about how my hair looks worse now (it doesn\\'t). After that, I left my email and told Kelly she could contact me to work something out. Then I got the f*** out of there. I\\'m sure other stylists there have done good work, and normally I would say that the stylist does not represent the whole of the salon, but Kelly was unbelievably rude. She is the owner of the salon and therefore she must own up to the work of her stylists. I would be willing to edit this review if she contacted me for a refund, but it really doesn\\'t seem like that\\'s her style. Please, please don\\'t give them your money.

The first couples massage we ever booked was at a luxury hotel in Los Angeles. They had us wear disposable underwear (!?) and lay face down as our therapists worked our muscles like silly putty. Our masseuses were short, stocky, Asian women who, at one point, climbed on top of our backs and dug in to our shoulder blades with their knees (!?). A few days ago, we went to a spa in town called Q's Spa. It's owned by a lovely woman named Q, who is petite, yet gives a hardy massage (she gave me mine). We started our visit with a tour of the facility, then were shown to our room where we changed in to white terry cloth bathrobes and slippers. Before the massage, we had a second room all to ourselves, with a display of grapes and strawberries, crackers, wine, and assorted chocolates. The steam closet was only a few paces away, so we alternated between the snack table and the room set to 98 degrees with 3000 percent humidity. Aside from dodging the hot water dripping from the ceiling, it was pleasant. Take-your-breath-away-while-sweating-out-toxins pleasant. Our massages were the highlight of our visit. We each had our own therapist who did well to work out the kinks with their hands and elbows. While they kept their feet on the ground, their use of hot stones sent me to La La Land in no time.

Kimberly was the stylist who fixed my hair, she took her time looking at it and even got a second opinion from another stylist, I could tell she really cared that my hair worked out. She spent hours putting in fine highlights, which turned out beautifully and did a great job blending the highlights from before (pictures below). I am actually super excited about my hair now and will definitely be back. I would definitely give 5 stars for the second visit!', 'positive'], ['Yalp — RedBloom Salon', 'For the last four years I have been in search of a consistent, creative and talented hairdresser. I first heard about RedBloom Salon at a bachelorette party where I met two women who had amazing haircuts and they both had hair stylists from RedBloom. I later discovered that a friend has been seeing the owner for over twelve years but she informed me that he is no longer taking on new clients. When I called to make an appointment they were all quite booked up but I was determined to wait as it has been a struggle for me to find the perfect hairdresser. The salon is located in a shopping complex filled with upscale shops and the salon was no exception. Please note that their address does not work in a GPS so I recommend going ahead of time because it is easy to get lost if you are not familiar with the area like me. When I arrived I was offered tea or coffee while I waited and they had me change into a comfortable smock. My stylist was prompt, polite and very nice to talk to. When she asked what I wanted to have done I told her that she was the artist and asked for her suggestion. Without hesitation she layed out her game plan, then went to the back and priced out two options and brought the info back to me on a small white board for me to view. As I have long hair, my first option was approx $250 for a cut and highlights and second was cheeper but for fewer highlights. I went with the first as I was in dire need of a full makeover...and that is what I left with! Each stylists pricing differs depending on experience. My girl was a mid level rating so I expect that the price varies within the salon. Since then I have returned again to the same girl with the same amazing results. I have another appointment next week.....here are a couple of other things that I look forward to when I go: The ambiance is nice...music is not blaring and the decor is very modern with a slight industrial look. All of the stylist take their time washing your hair, with an amazing scalp massage...they also massage your hands and fingers with lotion! Afterwards she wrapped my hands in hot towels and put one over my eyes. After your haircut they take you to the front where they have a makeup booth set up...they refresh your makeup and then you are on your way. I noted two things on my visits that I also want to make note of. If you are short like me the hair washing station may be uncomfortable for you and or drip water down your back. The other thing is that they really need to choose a better quality coffee to serve as I could hardly choke it down! Other than those two things which are not that important I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.', 'positive'], ['Yalp — RedBloom Salon', 'I switched over here because my hair dresser moved locations.

They give you a robe, offer you a drink, give a scalp/shoulder massage at the beginning of the appointment, and everyone is always very pleasant and helpful. I haven't seen anyone other than Christy R., but she's great and I can't say enough good things about her! She always takes a few minutes to sit and chat with me about what I want before she starts doing anything. And I've never gotten as many compliments about my hair as I have since seeing her.

I was super surprised at the low quality of my cut. I was not happy when the stylist could not style my bangs - at all. I had to leave the salon with my bangs sticking straight out from my forehead! As I was paying, there was another client who was leaving with 'party-ready' (It was the Christmas party season) hair - I was not. I had to go home and try and fix my bangs! Overall, the hairstyle had some layering, but the length was left too long providing me with an odd difference between the length and the first layer. A little mullet-like. Also, I felt the stylist was very quick cutting my hair and did not spend enough time on details. (I was there just over 30 mins. for $80) I had also provided a picture of me with my hair how I liked it and I had told the stylist it was important to me to have a 'good cut'. I had to go to two Christmas parties with this shoddy cut. I was pretty disappointed as this was the second time I had been to Redbloom in Bridgeland. The first time was with a junior stylist and again the cut was awful, but I thought that trying a senior stylist would solve the quality of cut problem. I thought I would try Redbloom again because I had mostly read really great reviews on Yelp. This appt. was 8 days before Christmas, so when I brought my disappointing style to RedBloom`s attention, they offered to squeeze me in, in the next week. Unfortunately, I had booked the appt. ahead of time knowing I would be getting busy prior to Christmas - I mean who isn`t? I was not able to make it back before Christmas and ended up cutting some of the length off myself so it was not so mullety. I mean who wants a mullet???\", 'negative'], ['Yalp — RedBloom Salon', \"Colour me impressed (and pardon the pun). I had a great first experience at Redbloom.

It was clean and well maintained compared to many I've been to around 17th ave. They do all the usual stuff of a higher end salon PLUS nice added touches like hand massages. My stylist Jami was a great listener and offered some good ideas on how to tame my lion's mane of hair. And she delivered. I have thicker, wavy hair and in the past have had stylists run screaming but she patiently worked with my hair and gave me awesome highlights and a great cut that made the most of the beast that is my hair. She took her time, in a good way and I am very happy with the results. She helped me choose product that would help be maintain the beast without hard selling. And I found the cost of the cut, highlights AND product all together was cheaper than most other similar salons I've been to in Calgary. Score!

I have been getting my hair cut by Christie R for for ages and even followed her during a hiatious to another salon (thankfully she returned back to this location which is conviently 2 blocks from my house). Christie is so easy to chat with (be it movies, TV, old and new flames or me trying to decide on the color of the week) and does an amazingly consistant cut each and every time. Her colors/highlights also turn out perfect every time I have had to cover the \"arctic grey\". The salon atmosphere itself is FUN, easy going, not pretentious and the staff are extremely friendly and professional. Perks include the hot towels after a shampoo (niiiice after a long work day), hand massages while processing color and a shoulder massage while getting going.! The full experience is quite a treat and doesn\\'t feel like a chore to squeeze in during a busy week. The fact it is an Aveda salon is also a huge draw seeing a Shampure is the best shampoo on the planet and the mens styling products have been a fav of mine for 10 years. At last count I had a partner, a sister, a mother and coworker all going to this location and everyone is a fan...so rest assured - you won\\'t be disappointed.

It's like breaking up with someone, without all the drunk texting. I enjoyed my previous stylist for the fundamentals but decided to buy a Groupon for Red Bloom based on my brother's experiences with it. There is plenty of parking around the Bridgeland shopping area, so you'll have no trouble there. RedBloom uses AVEDA products and the AVEDA techniques for styling and colouring. You are in for an absolute treat. Upon entering, a nice receiptionist always welcomes you and offers to take your coat. You change into a nice little robe and are always offered a drink. (Not sure if they serve alcoholic drinks or not) The waiting area is always nice and clean and you usually aren't waiting there for too long. I have been seeing Ashley, an intermediate stylist for about a year now. She is a sweet girl with great talent. RedBloom charges by the type of stylist: student, intermediate, advanced and Master. But I imagine anyone you get will be amazing given the way Aveda teaches their students. While your colour processes, the stylist provides hand massages using Aveda hand cream. So awesome. I feel Ashley always spends a lot of time styling my hair, and ensuring all roots are thoroughly covered. There have been a couple of times when I have requested something that has taken longer than my appointment allowed and Ashley was great to accommodate. There was even a time when we stayed past closing! When you are all done, they always offer to touch up your make up with some lip gloss and translucent powder. What is better than that for a night out? Nudding! The price is just below other high end salons I would say. I pay about 170$ for colour and cut. Maybe even less than that. I highly recommend this salon for men and for women. I've even recommended my mom! It's a family affair down at RedBloom Bridgeland. Which reminds me, I have to make an appointment, the tall men in my office are commenting on my gray hair again :S p.s.

The folks who answer the phone are helpful and if I can't get in with the stylist I have used in the past - they will make a suggestion. I usually know what I want done when I go it, but the odd time I will ask for a suggestion. The stylists are helpful and friendly - I get the feeling that they like where they work and it makes a huge difference in their service.

My barber would pause to watch the television while cutting my hair....and I mean pause 5-15 seconds. - They force everyone to sign into this stupid electronic system instead of just making people wait and it is a mess. If you do not have a smartphone or just don\\'t feel like giving them your information, they make you feel uncomfortable. - They do not have the prices posted. Yes, this is getting to be like Africa.... My barber charged me 22$ for a haircut that he messed up on. I came back, and talked to Tatianna...I guess... and asked \"how much does a haircut cost here?\" I wanted to check the price prior to asking for a fix.

I will run through a creek bare footed and pick up a frog with my bare hands. I'm not a fashionista, and I would say I'm not even really that cool. I mean, I am cool, but that nerdy type of artsy cool. So after that senseless ramble above, what's my point, right? Well, although I may not be the most trendy gal around, I do have a crazy obsession with my hair. I grow it out, cut it off, color it blonde, go back to brown, add red, highlights, color, layers etc. I can't get enough. Sassy Salon is a small little place in a strip mall that looks a bit deceiving as you drive by. I can honestly tell you, I would have never just wandered into this place by chance. I have NO idea how I even came across the place originally, but I can tell you why I go there now. I work for a company that makes us stay pretty conservative with our hair styles and color. Being an artsy fartsy type, I cannot stand that and I get bored pretty easily. A gal I work with came in with a cutting edge style and color that stuck out, even in a conservative work place, but was still considered acceptable. I asked her where she went, and Sassy Salon is the place she recommended. I drove over for the first time, and told Van what I wanted, or at least an idea of it. She saw the pictures that I wasn't allowed to do at work, and came up with the low key versions to still help me not feel plain. She and Song are so personable and friendly, and I enjoy going to get my hair done here. First, she listens to what you truly want, and my hair always looks great. Second... OH MY GOD, the scalp massage. It is AMAZINGGGGGGGG.... I wasn't even expecting that the first time I'd gone. When she took me over to the bowl to rinse my hair, this amazing relaxing massage started and I thought I was going to have to be carried out of the place from sheer relaxation. I'm just glad I didn't pass out and start drooling on myself. Wow... I'd go there and pay them JUST for the scalp massage!!! They do accept walk ins, but she is in high demand, so it's not always easy to get a walk in. I'd say to get an appointment, makes it easier on you and the salon. I always feel great when I leave, and the best part is the price. I usually get a highlight, low light, cut and scalp massage for around $80.

No where in the gift certificate did it state it wouldn't be worth the entire amount ever nor did it have an expiration date. Then they ended up put a 40$ service fee added on top... ended up paying $70 more on top of the gift certificate that was already over 120$.

I was 21 weeks and I did not know what to expect. Evelyn was such a sweetheart! She's so soft spoken that sometimes it's hard to hear her but she's so polite and accommodating. She throughly explained the massage to me to make sure I knew exactly what to expect during this prenatal massage. She started off very gentle and didn't put much pressure on back. I had to ask for more pressure. I normally love deep tissue massages and hate Swedish massage because it's too soft. She was more than understanding and made adjustments as requested. She explained that most first time pregnant women are often afraid of too much pressure on their back/ belly so she always start off soft and adjust as needed. I had my massage on my side. I expected the typical donut type tables for the preggo belly but she explained that it was better to start on my side as this was my first prenatal massage. I'm glad I listened. The scalp and neck part of the massage was incredible! The massage itself was excellent! I felt so much better! So relaxing and my muscles feel much less tight. One thing worth mentioning was the lack of aroma therapy. Most spas smell amazing the minute you walk in. They usually had scented candles to set the mood for relaxation. I was expecting that but that wasn't the case here! It was really odd. It didn't have that spa smell during my visit and I kept thinking I should take deeper breaths to inhale the lavender scent but there was nothing there. Whomp whomp! The spa was very clean.

I decided on a Quench Pedicure followed by a Coconut Sugar Glow (80 minute with massage). First impressions: I decided to head down about an hour or so before my treatments to enjoy the spa a bit beforehand. I checked in and was taken in to get my shoes and robe and place my things in a locker. I checked out the spa area and decided to read my book in the area near the cold/hot dunk pools. The fruit infused water they had on hand was very refreshing and I relaxed and read for a bit. Unfortunately the weekend I was in Vegas was the rainiest/coldest they had had in awhile so I did not get to try the pool area outside (though I really wanted to!) One thing I noticed that didn\\'t go away, if anything was more noticeable, was that there was a stale smoke smell in the spa. The casino is right out the doors and obviously the ventilation system is not the best since it was apparent even within the confines of Spa Aquae. Pedicure: My pedicurist was very sweet and we had a lovely conversation. She wasn\\'t as thorough with my feet as I would have liked, but they looked pretty when she was finished. One thing I did notice (and it ended up being a problem) is that they don\\'t really have an area/equipment to stick your feet to dry the toes. She fanned at my toes with a set of salon flip flops but they weren\\'t completely dry for my next treatment in 15 minutes. The problem came when I laid face down on the massage table, my big toes ended up getting smudged big time (which I didn\\'t notice until I was getting redressed in the locker room). For the price, that was disappointing. Sugar Glow/Massage: This service was amazing and worth every penny. My skin felt so soft afterwards and the massage done at the end confirmed my new identity as butter. The facilities were dimly lit and the table comfortable. The shower that I had to use to rinse off the sugar could definitely use an update (broken tiles, etc). I would have this service completed again in the future as it was a nice alternative to a traditional massage. Overall experience: Am I happy I had some \"me\" time at the spa? Of course. Would I return to this location and pay the prices listed? (I had a discount with the group I was with): No. I would research and find another spa in town. The stale smoky smell that permeated the spa areas was also troublesome because let\\'s face it, it\\'s the last thing you want lingering in the air when you\\'re trying to relax.', 'negative'], ['Yalp — Spa Aquae', 'This place is a hidden gem!

The chairs are super uncomfortable and look like outdoor furniture. The steam room should just be called a warm room because there was almost no steam. I went outside and enjoyed the pool but noticed most of their 'water therapy' spots were broken. The grout in the pool and spa outside are missing. There are holes in the sides of the pool.

Today, I would say there is too much deferred maintenance including filthy plunge pools (e.g., cloudy with hair and band aids floating in them rather than Crystal clear water), moldy grout (mold in the desert!), and cracked tiles. It also doesn't help that the scent of cigarette smoke from the casino drifts into the upstairs relaxation/waiting room. If you want good bodywork or a facial from nice people, then go for it.

But since I am a loyal Marriott customer and know they CAN offer an amazing spa experience, I bumped them up. However, I wouldn\\'t say this one is \"awesome\". First, before we even arrived, I was a little unsure about the atmosphere based on all the pictures on the web. The photos looked more like America\\'s Next Top Model Challenges, that just happened to be set in the spa. The ridiculous poses on the pedicure chairs and plenty of pictures of glamour shots of the girls didn\\'t help me get a feel for the actual spa facilities. We stopped in anyways to hang out and schedule a couple of services - since our experience at other spa\\'s have been amazing, we figured this was a safe bet. On my first visit in over the course of my stay, check-in was a touch painful and involved 2 people to complete: the one very helpful guy and the girl that just stared back at me from behind the desk. It was awkward. She then escorted me to the locker room. And that was were it ended. The locker room attendant proved to be a hit or miss deal - on this particular time she was behind the counter, but many other times during my multiple visits, the desk was empty. I received no real tour of the facilities except for standing in the middle of the room, pointing in the direction of things. I can only tell you for sure that they offer bathrooms, a hot tub and sauna. Those are all the things I found. The facility itself was clean and nice. The locker room is a shared space for getting naked, getting dressed, grooming and...eating? There is a kitchen in the middle of it - which does nothing for me. I think it is a little gross actually. They offer a gym which seemed to be pretty good except for the first 3 treadmills I tried didn\\'t work. While a tad small, they do offer a private pool for the spa guests, which is much nicer than the family circus pool in the main area. However, it is by a walkway so that you are completely on display and with no umbrellas, there is no escaping the sun all day. One thing that stood out compared to other experience, was the lack of pool service. No one came by to take a drink order, clear away used towels or uneaten food, or even do a general picking up. Ii certainly didn\\'t notice any leftover food and used towels lying about in the photos! This was the case throughout the 3 days we were at the spa. It definitely kills the ambiance - especially if you are paying for services or paid to just hang out. We also ran into a snafu and poor service when trying to order lunch. As for the services, I can\\'t complain at all. You have to try pretty hard to make a massage terrible. And the facial was one of the best yet. So at least Aquae Sulis can deliver on the spa treatments...which they do well, so there is hope! They just need to spend less time on the glamour shots and more time on actually creating a glamorous experience.

I almost missed the waterfall showers but luckily I didn't. They were so unusual I used them twice. Nothing like heavy water falling on your aching muscles, pooling at your feet.

He was professional and courteous, providing the right amount of pressure and making me feel completely relaxed. I usually don't get a male massage therapist but in the future I'd want to clone him. The facial was OK. My skin gets super dry in the desert, so it was necessary but expensive. On par with other hotel spa services, but the facial felt standard, nothing special. The gym was spacious and quiet. They had an ample number of cardio machines and decent weights. I think they tack on an extra $25 or $35 fee if you are just using the gym without a spa treatment (not including waxing), the higher fee if you aren't a hotel guest.

Plus, now I've got regrowth And yes, when I calculated what i paid to your salon, i did include the generous tips i left.

After growing out my grey hair for three years, while keeping it long, I decided I'd put a few DIY highlights at the front of my bangs, where the hair is still pretty dark. Dumb idea. I went for a fix, but the tone was still off, so I called Texture, where there's a really great colourist who knows how to work with grey. She wasn't available, and I was heading into two weeks of travel and client presentations, so I asked if there was anyone else there experienced at matching grey hair. I was told that Allison, the owner, was. I paid $170 for silver highlights in my bangs. Unfortunately, Allison made a mess of it, giving me big yellow streaks that didn't match my hair at all, then, as an initial attempt to correct the problem, extending it all about three inches back into my natural hair. The result was terrible, dwarfing the issue I started with. The only solution at that point was to put a demi colour on the whole thing to try and get rid of the now very large section of yellowed hair and create some semblance of a unified colour. I understand that mistakes happen. Such is life. But Allison then charged me an additional $75 for the 'fix', bringing me up to $250 for my botched bangs (not to mention the hours i spent at the salon), which still don't match. I was also told that i would now need to tone this big front section of hair, now, every few weeks to keep the yellow at bay, until it grows out - in about a year or so.

I am typically loyal to a local barber. For the first time in a long time, I have received compliments on my hair after Melissa cut it. Multiple compliments. Seriously, my look is similar, but my hair looks sharper and it has probably been 30 years since anyone even noticed it.

The review in question states it is a bit expensive for a \"humble cut.\" I would say it is a humble price for a professional cut. The price is less than 20 bucks. It cost about the same as a fast food trip for two. It is very expensive to keep a small business running these days. Priced health insurance lately? Rent? Even if you go to a chain, you are going to pay this in many cases. My wife pays anywhere from 3 to 5 times this amount. You can find cheaper barbers. As I have stated, I am sticking with this place for the foreseeable future. I am a value buyer. I look for \"bang for the buck.\" The review in question states that there are two \"distractions.\" One of those is an attractive, \"cool\" person cutting your hair. Um... Why does the persons appearance have anything to do with the product? I am really scratching my head over this one. If you are insecure, yeah, you can go to another place I guess. I didn\\'t give it a thought. She can weigh a hundred pounds, or 250 pounds, as long as I walk away with the same quality hair cut. Now for the complete disconnect. The other reviewer states that the haircut is served up with attitude. What!? Just disregard that. That is so far from reality that I can only guess that it either was tied to the other issue with the stylists looks, or maybe he just had a bad day, at worst a misunderstanding. I have waited in there with every seat full, half of them with guys like me, half with kids with cool young cuts. The owner walked over and poured us each a cup of coffee if we wanted one. Politely and professionally. She always shows concern for the length of your wait and gives you updates. The salon has a consultative approach. You will be asked some polite, concise questions to insure you get the cut you want. The communication is very good. I also learned about new hair products (who knew that styling gel was so 1980\\'s). Melissa recommended a product that works fantastic on my hair and keeps it in place. It is similar to going to a good establishment to buy a suit. They consult with you and make you look better. I need all the help I can get. Give it a try. Great customer service and work ethic. Great hair cut.', 'positive'], ['Yalp — The Man Cave Salon', 'I had been looking for a place to get my hair cut as my previous barber closed her shop. I wanted someplace close to home (Stow) but I was willing to drive to find a shop I felt comfortable at. Man Cave is that type of place. Melissa took my appointment on short notice and when I first walked in they have a big chalkboard with a quote on it from Bob Feller (one of my all-time favorite Indians) and a chalk drawing of Chief Wahoo, I really liked this ambiance. Melissa is a good barber/stylist, I explained what I wanted and she completed the cut perfectly. I like to have hair rinsed after the cut and it was no problem.

I finally saw this place with excellent reviews and decided that if Kristy could see me - I would give it a shot. I never imagined that I would recommend her services to all my friends and even the people I meet out and about. What's so great about the Shear Shack. Well Kristy for one, but as you've seen on other reviews, Chelsea now for reason number 2. They often overlap with each other so I feel confident in Chelsea's abilities/training and customer service since Kristy is there teaching her how she runs the Shack. So reason number 3 is all the compliments I get on my hair. Which translates into expertise and skill. These compliments range from the color (usually something in the reds but her crafty color skills are dazzling), the healthy shine, the bounce and volume, the realistic look...I could just keep going. Kristy takes the time to consider more than just what a client wants, but what is realistic. She discusses the pros and cons, and helps guide the client through the process. Kristy will advise the client on how to achieve the end result and maintain the integrity of the hair. #4 Cost - SUPER REASONABLE. You get what you pay for. So if you want a $15 haircut - your hair will probably look like you got a $15 hair cut. Kristy's prices sometimes surprise me in how reasonable they are. I like to touch up my roots (again, red is not the easiest color to maintain when your hair grows super fast) every three-four weeks. This would cost me a fortune at other salons, but Kristy keeps it super reasonable. In fact, her prices were one of the reasons I chose her. I've had whole color applications, high lights, low lights, cuts, styles, and loved what I paid every time. #5 Time and Respect. I've never waited more than ~10 minutes before for an appointment. Kristy books responsibly and holds her appointments. She is always there when she says she is. I know I can count on her keeping to our time so I don't miss a hot date later that night. Once, I even missed my appointment and she called and was able to reschedule me. I loved that she understood I had forgotten (one and time - I'm a woman of my word too) but still really needed my hair fixed up.

The first time I met Shirley was at the consultation, where she took me though the whole process and I showed her pictures of the brow shape I wanted, which is was how I filled my brows in myself for years. She wasted no time by drawing out a shape that was best for me. Originally I wanted to follow the natural shape of my brow, which slopes downwards, but she recommended a different shape to open up my eye. At first I was nervous, but I trusted her professional opinion and am SO GLAD I did! She applied a numbing cream and used a laser to numb to brow area. I was surprised that in less than 5 mins my brows were numb-then she started to microblade. you can hear (but not feel) it. By the end of the procedure I couldn't feel a thing! I haven't had my final touch up yet, but am loving my new brows so far and am confident the final product will only be better. I am so glad I went to Shirley for microblading, as her knowledge and experience definitely show. Her concern is genuine, and I think that's very important when letting someone perform this kind of procedure on your face.

After 2 hours there was an incredible amount of adhesive still stuck in my hair whilst she proceeded to explain to me that this was typical for tape in extensions, which it is not. I spoke with manufacturer about their products and tape has a cold bonding adhesive and is NOT to be applied with heat as this will melt the adhesive into the hair and cause the damage I have described above.

I was shocked and appalled when I read many of the reviews posted here about Wavelengths Hair studio and later in my review I will address these concerns in greater detail but first my experience at this salon I recently decided to make the change and go with fusion extensions instead of having to clip in my extensions every time I needed long hair, which turns out to be a lot with the work that I do. So I began to research my options both online and by phone; believe me I spent much time gathering info and comparing salons but Joice stood out immediately as she was one of the only ones who would quote prices on the phone and the only one who provided a variety of options, catering towards quality but affordability. I called back many times with a barrage of questions which she answered politely and efficiently with a keen understanding of the care and consideration something like this takes. I eventually decided to go with one of the options she presented me with, which was to go buy my own hair (which would work out cheaper) and she would apply it. She quoted me a very affordable price and was accommodating schedule-wise so I set my appointment. The salon itself is located on a little side street called Irwin with surprisingly ample parking as there is street parking and underground public parking just up the street. Small but tidy and quaint this is a full service hair salon with the specialty in Hair Extensions. As soon as I walked in I recognized not only the voice but the generally warm and friendly vibe I got from speaking with Joice on the phone. I came in with a bang, almost knocking over a mirror and chair in my clumsiness but she was her bubbly and accommodating self and made me feel right at home. She explained to me the process and some info about care, maintenance ect.. but as she proceeded she noticed I had bought pre-bonded keratin packs, which she informed me wouldn't be the ideal option so she went with a shank method that was MUCH more expensive but because she quoted me a certain price on the phone she actually honored that. I was SHOCKED! Not only that but she really knew her craft and how to work the best she could with the materials provided. Throughout it all she was conscious of price and quality even making the move to space out my extensions because I had only bought 100g though she made it look full and natural. My hairstylist even went out of her way to compliment the job and I have trusted her opinion for a while now as she has saved my hair many a time from silly dye jobs and wacky cement hair styles. Joice even gave me a clip in highlight cause I was asking about pink highlights, really the generosity was incredible! The whole procedure was no more then 2hrs in total, prob not even that and it was a pleasure to sit and chat with such a kindred spirit like Joice so the time passes by even quicker. After it was done I couldn't get over the feeling of the hair it was amazing! So light and natural looking... blended perfectly and was literally invisible even with my hair up . The salon itself also offers a fantastic incentive for referral too, any guest you refer gives you 15% off your next visit now I have never heard of that before. She also gave me a very reasonable deal to remove them when it comes time and if I do choose to get them redone it will DEFINITELY be here!! Now I have never done this before but feel compelled to call out the two resoundingly negative reviews I have read here because I feel Yelp is a place for people to find TRUTHFUL, HELPFUL and HONEST reviews not petty, childish attacks at a business and persons reputation. These businesses are run by human beings that deserve the respect of decency and making personal attacks publicly and using yelp to slander or berate someone is not what this site is intended for. We as reviewers have an obligation to not only be truthful and respectful but be mindful of the consequences of our words as these are peoples livelihoods we are affecting after all.

Also I found her salon to be very comfortable unlike the typical rushed, hectic and sales-like atmosphere of other salons. Make sure you do your own research on where to buy your hair to get the best-looking and quality hair - Joyce will have suggestions as well, and from what I understand she will start to carry her own supply. She seems to really know what good quality hair is, but as to where to buy it you must do ur own research !
